# Influenza drift in a notebook

The H3N2 vaccine is reformulated because the virus's hemagglutinin changes where
antibodies bind it, while its HA2 fusion peptide has to stay the same for the
protein to work. In a Jupyter notebook with `jbrowsemsa`, for the 25 strains
chosen for the northern hemisphere vaccine from 1968 to 2022, we:

- fetch the hemagglutinins and align them in year order
- infer a tree and check it against the dates
- count each column's changes between strains and add them as a track
- mark antigenic site B and the fusion peptide, and read both year by year
- read clicks back into Python and share the view as a link

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or newer, in a notebook (JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code,
  Colab, or marimo)
- `pip install jbrowsemsa biopython numpy pandas`
- ClustalW, `apt install clustalw` on Debian or Ubuntu, `brew install clustal-w`
  on macOS

## The data

NCBI protein records, one per vaccine strain as
[WHO published them](https://www.who.int/teams/global-influenza-programme/vaccines/who-recommendations),
fetched by accession so a rerun aligns the same sequences. The commands below
fetch these. Nothing to download.

## 1. List the strains

Each entry names a year, the strain WHO chose for that season, and the accession
of its full-length HA0 record:

```python
STRAINS = [
    (1968, "A/Hong Kong/1/1968", "AFG71887.1"),
    (1972, "A/England/42/1972", "AFM71912.1"),
    (1975, "A/Victoria/3/1975", "AFG98995.1"),
    # ... 21 more, through
    (2021, "A/Darwin/9/2021", "XZO11388.1"),
    (2022, "A/Massachusetts/18/2022", "YGK08660.1"),
]

strains = pd.DataFrame(STRAINS, columns=["year", "strain", "accession"])
strains["row"] = [
    f"{year}_{strain.split('/')[1].replace(' ', '')}"
    for year, strain in zip(strains.year, strains.strain)
]
```

An Entrez search for the strain name,
`"A/Darwin/9/2021"[All Fields] AND hemagglutinin[Protein Name]`, found each
accession. The list is pinned, because the same search next year can return a
different first hit.

`strains.row` is the label the viewer draws down the side, year first so the
rows sort by date, and with no space so it survives as a Newick tip name.

## 2. Fetch the records

```python
with Entrez.efetch(
    db="protein", id=",".join(strains.accession), rettype="fasta", retmode="text"
) as handle:
    records = {r.id: r for r in SeqIO.parse(handle, "fasta")}

for row, accession in zip(strains.row, strains.accession):
    records[accession].id = row
    records[accession].description = ""

ordered = [records[a] for a in strains.accession]
SeqIO.write(ordered, "h3n2-ha.fasta", "fasta")
```

```
 year                  strain  accession  length
 1968      A/Hong Kong/1/1968 AFG71887.1     566
 1972       A/England/42/1972 AFM71912.1     566
 1975       A/Victoria/3/1975 AFG98995.1     566
   ...                    ...        ...     ...
 2021         A/Darwin/9/2021 XZO11388.1     566
 2022 A/Massachusetts/18/2022 YGK08660.1     566
```

All 25 are 566 residues: a 16-residue signal peptide, then HA1 at 329 residues,
then HA2. H3 numbering counts from HA1's first residue, so every position quoted
below is that number plus 16.

## 3. Align the records in year order

```python
subprocess.run(
    ["clustalw", "-INFILE=h3n2-ha.fasta", "-ALIGN", "-TYPE=PROTEIN",
     "-OUTPUT=FASTA", "-OUTFILE=h3n2-ha.aln"],
    check=True,
)
aligned = {r.id: r for r in SeqIO.parse("h3n2-ha.aln", "fasta")}
SeqIO.write([aligned[row] for row in strains.row], "h3n2-ha.aln", "fasta")
```

```
alignment: 25 rows x 567 columns
```

The second write puts the rows back in year order. ClustalW writes them in
guide-tree order, which puts a 2013 strain first.

[![](../media/flu-drift-alignment.png)](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/#data=%7B%22msaview%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22MsaView%22%2C%22height%22%3A640%2C%22treeAreaWidth%22%3A210%2C%22colWidth%22%3A2.2%2C%22rowHeight%22%3A16%2C%22colorSchemeName%22%3A%22clustalx_protein_dynamic%22%2C%22msaFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fh3n2%2Fh3n2-ha.aln%22%7D%7D%7D)

The 25 hemagglutinins in year order, 1968 at the top. The alignment is 567
columns wide, one more than every record, because A/Victoria/3/1975 has an extra
residue near the end of the signal peptide.

## 4. Infer a tree and check it against the dates

Biopython builds a neighbor-joining tree from the alignment alone, rooted on the
1968 strain:

```python
msa = MultipleSeqAlignment([aligned[row] for row in strains.row])
tree = DistanceTreeConstructor().nj(DistanceCalculator("blosum62").get_distance(msa))
tree.root_with_outgroup(strains.row[0])
Phylo.write(tree, "h3n2-ha.nh", "newick")
```

Distance from the 1968 root should grow with the year, which the tree never saw:

```python
depth = tree.depths()
distance = [depth[t] for t in tree.get_terminals()]
year = [int(t.name.split("_")[0]) for t in tree.get_terminals()]
np.corrcoef(distance, year)[0, 1]
```

```
root-to-tip distance against year: r = 0.985
```

[![](../media/flu-drift-tree.png)](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/#data=%7B%22msaview%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22MsaView%22%2C%22height%22%3A640%2C%22treeAreaWidth%22%3A210%2C%22colWidth%22%3A2.2%2C%22rowHeight%22%3A16%2C%22colorSchemeName%22%3A%22clustalx_protein_dynamic%22%2C%22msaFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fh3n2%2Fh3n2-ha.aln%22%7D%2C%22treeFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fh3n2%2Fh3n2-ha.nh%22%7D%7D%7D)

The tree beside the alignment, with the 1968 root at the top and branch lengths
growing down the series.

## 5. Count the changes between consecutive strains

For each column, count how often the letter changed from one vaccine strain to
the next:

```python
columns = np.array([list(str(aligned[row].seq)) for row in strains.row])
changes = (columns[:-1] != columns[1:]).sum(axis=0)
```

```
columns that never changed: 449 of 567
the busiest column changed 11 times
the 2022 strain matches the 1968 one in 479 of 567 columns
```

The `column_tracks` trait takes the counts as one bar per column, and `values`
takes the numpy array as it is:

```python
drift = {
    "id": "drift",
    "name": "Changes between consecutive strains",
    "kind": "bar",
    "values": changes,
    "scales": {"y": {"domainMax": int(changes.max())}},
    "color": "#c0392b",
    "height": 60,
}
```

## 6. Mark the antigenic sites and the fusion peptide

Antigenic site B is two stretches of HA1, 155 to 160 and 186 to 198, on the rim
of the receptor-binding site, and the fusion peptide is the first 11 residues of
HA2. Both go in as highlights on the 1968 row, which the viewer projects onto
columns:

```python
SIGNAL, HA1_LENGTH = 16, 329
reference = strains.row[0]

def h3(position):
    """H3 numbering -> residue of the record, which counts the signal peptide."""
    return position + SIGNAL

bands = [
    {"row": reference, "start": h3(155), "end": h3(160), "label": "site B 155-160"},
    {"row": reference, "start": h3(186), "end": h3(198), "label": "site B 186-198"},
    {"row": reference, "start": h3(HA1_LENGTH + 1), "end": h3(HA1_LENGTH + 11),
     "label": "fusion peptide", "color": "rgba(0,120,255,0.18)"},
]
```

Everything so far goes into the widget in one call:

```python
from jbrowsemsa import MSAView

view = MSAView(
    msa="h3n2-ha.aln",
    tree="h3n2-ha.nh",
    column_tracks=[drift],
    highlights=bands,
    relative_to=reference,
    col_width=2.2,
    row_height=16,
    height=700,
)
view
```

The drift track over the alignment, with `relative_to` drawing every row as its
differences from 1968. The two orange bands are site B, the blue band is the
fusion peptide, and the red bars are tallest in HA1.

## 7. Read site B and the fusion peptide year by year

```python
residue_column = np.cumsum([c != "-" for c in str(aligned[reference].seq)])

def column_of(residue):
    return int(np.argmax(residue_column == residue))

site_b = [h3(p) for start, end in [(155, 160), (186, 198)] for p in range(start, end + 1)]
fusion = list(range(h3(HA1_LENGTH + 1), h3(HA1_LENGTH + 11) + 1))
def read(positions):
    at = [column_of(r) for r in positions]
    return ["".join(columns[i, at]) for i in range(len(strains))]

pd.DataFrame({
    "year": strains.year,
    "site B (155-160, 186-198)": read(site_b),
    "fusion peptide (HA2 1-11)": read(fusion),
})
```

The fusion peptide at the same resolution, where the boxed column holds its one
substitution in the series, leucine in 1968 and 1972 and isoleucine in the 23
strains after them.

## 8. Read clicks back in Python

The browser sets two traits on the widget: `clicked`, the cell a click pinned,
and `viewport`, the columns on screen:

```python
def show(change):
    cell = change["new"]
    if cell:
        print(cell["row"], cell["column"], cell["letter"])

view.observe(show, "clicked")
```

`column` and `residue` count from 1, `column` over every alignment column and
`residue` over the clicked row's letters, so a click indexes back into the
DataFrame:

```python
view.observe(
    lambda change: display(
        pd.DataFrame({
            "year": strains.year,
            "letter": columns[:, change["new"]["column"] - 1],
        })
    ),
    "clicked",
)
```

Setting a trait such as `view.color_scheme` or `view.highlights` redraws the
widget in place and keeps its scroll and zoom.

## 9. Share the link

<!-- usage: web -->

The drift track and the bands also go into a URL that opens the hosted alignment
in the web viewer, for a reader with no kernel:

```python
snapshot = {"msaview": {
    "type": "MsaView",
    "height": 560,
    "colWidth": 2.2,
    "rowHeight": 16,
    "colorSchemeName": "clustalx_protein_dynamic",
    "msaFilehandle": {"uri": "data/h3n2/h3n2-ha.aln"},
    "treeFilehandle": {"uri": "data/h3n2/h3n2-ha.nh"},
    "columnTracks": [{**drift, "values": changes.tolist()}],
    "highlights": bands,
}}
"https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/#data=" + urllib.parse.quote(
    json.dumps(snapshot, separators=(",", ":")), safe=""
)
```

```
the link is 3332 characters
```

`json.dumps` needs `changes.tolist()`, where the widget took the numpy array
whole.

<!-- usage: r -->

[ggmsaview](https://github.com/GMOD/ggmsaview) opens the same hosted alignment
and tree, and reads the drift counts and the three bands from
`h3n2-layers.json`:

```r
library(ggmsaview)
data <- "https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/data/h3n2/"
layers <- jsonlite::fromJSON(paste0(data, "h3n2-layers.json"))
drift <- layers$columnTracks
bands <- layers$highlights
w <- msaview(msa = paste0(data, "h3n2-ha.aln"),
    tree = paste0(data, "h3n2-ha.nh"),
    color_scheme = "clustalx_protein_dynamic") +
  geom_msa_track(drift$values[[1]], name = drift$name, id = drift$id,
    domain_max = drift$scales$y$domainMax, color = drift$color,
    height = drift$height) +
  geom_msa_highlight(bands)
w
ggplot2::ggsave("flu-drift-share-r.png",
  msaview_plot(w, tracks = "drift"), width = 12, height = 7)
```

![](../media/flu-drift-share-r.png)

The 25 strains in tree order beside the drift track, whose red bars are tallest
in HA1 under the two orange site B bands, between columns 150 and 250. The blue
fusion-peptide band sits over columns with almost no changes.

<!-- /usage -->

## Reproduce it end to end

[`build_flu_drift.py`](https://github.com/GMOD/JBrowseMSA/blob/main/docs/tutorials/scripts/build_flu_drift.py)
runs the steps above in a plain Python process, without the widget:

1. It fetches the 25 HA0 records from NCBI in one request, aligns them with
   ClustalW and restores year order.
2. It builds a neighbor-joining tree rooted on the 1968 strain and correlates
   root-to-tip distance with year.
3. It counts how often each column changed between consecutive strains, and
   reads site B and the fusion peptide year by year.
4. It writes the drift track and the bands as a layers file, and the `#data=`
   link that opens them over the hosted alignment.

It needs the tools under [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/JBrowseMSA/main/docs/tutorials/scripts/build_flu_drift.py
python build_flu_drift.py out/
```

The script writes `out/h3n2-ha.aln`, `out/h3n2-ha.nh` and
`out/h3n2-layers.json`, which the links on this page open, and prints the
numbers quoted here.
