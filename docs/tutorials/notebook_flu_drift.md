# Influenza drift in a notebook

The H3N2 vaccine is reformulated because the virus's hemagglutinin changes where
antibodies bind it. This page takes the 25 H3N2 strains chosen for the northern
hemisphere vaccine between 1968 and 2022, aligns their hemagglutinin, counts how
often each column changed from one strain to the next, and draws the result in
Jupyter with `msaview-widget`. The alignment carries its own control: the HA2
fusion peptide, which has to stay the same for the protein to work, sits in the
same 567 columns as the antigenic sites that change every few years.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or newer, in a notebook (JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code,
  Colab, or marimo)
- `pip install msaview-widget biopython numpy pandas`
- ClustalW, `apt install clustalw` on Debian or Ubuntu, `brew install clustal-w`
  on macOS

## The data

NCBI protein records, one per vaccine strain as
[WHO published them](https://www.who.int/teams/global-influenza-programme/vaccines/who-recommendations),
fetched by accession so a rerun aligns the same sequences. The commands below
fetch these. Nothing to download.

## 1. The strains

Each row is a year, the strain WHO named for that season, and the accession of a
full-length HA0 record for it.

```python
STRAINS = [
    (1968, "A/Hong Kong/1/1968", "AFG71887.1"),
    (1972, "A/England/42/1972", "AFM71912.1"),
    (1975, "A/Victoria/3/1975", "AFG98995.1"),
    # ... 21 more, through
    (2021, "A/Darwin/9/2021", "XZO11388.1"),
    (2022, "A/Massachusetts/18/2022", "YGK08660.1"),
]

strains = pd.DataFrame(STRAINS, columns=["year", "strain", "accession"])
strains["row"] = [
    f"{year}_{strain.split('/')[1].replace(' ', '')}"
    for year, strain in zip(strains.year, strains.strain)
]
```

Each accession came from one Entrez search of the protein database for the
strain name, `"A/Darwin/9/2021"[All Fields] AND hemagglutinin[Protein Name]`. A
strain has several records, some of them partial, and the one kept is the
full-length HA0 of 566 residues. The build script at the bottom of this page
pins the list above, because a search run next year can return a different first
hit.

`strains.row` is the label the viewer draws down the side: the year first, so
the rows sort by date and a Newick tip name carries no space.

## 2. Fetch the records

```python
with Entrez.efetch(
    db="protein", id=",".join(strains.accession), rettype="fasta", retmode="text"
) as handle:
    records = {r.id: r for r in SeqIO.parse(handle, "fasta")}

for row, accession in zip(strains.row, strains.accession):
    records[accession].id = row
    records[accession].description = ""

ordered = [records[a] for a in strains.accession]
SeqIO.write(ordered, "h3n2-ha.fasta", "fasta")
```

```
 year                  strain  accession  length
 1968      A/Hong Kong/1/1968 AFG71887.1     566
 1972       A/England/42/1972 AFM71912.1     566
 1975       A/Victoria/3/1975 AFG98995.1     566
   ...                    ...        ...     ...
 2021         A/Darwin/9/2021 XZO11388.1     566
 2022 A/Massachusetts/18/2022 YGK08660.1     566
```

All 25 are 566 residues: a 16-residue signal peptide, then HA1 at 329 residues,
then HA2. H3 numbering counts from HA1's first residue, so every position quoted
below is that number plus 16.

## 3. Align

```python
subprocess.run(
    ["clustalw", "-INFILE=h3n2-ha.fasta", "-ALIGN", "-TYPE=PROTEIN",
     "-OUTPUT=FASTA", "-OUTFILE=h3n2-ha.aln"],
    check=True,
)
aligned = {r.id: r for r in SeqIO.parse("h3n2-ha.aln", "fasta")}
SeqIO.write([aligned[row] for row in strains.row], "h3n2-ha.aln", "fasta")
```

```
alignment: 25 rows x 567 columns
```

The second write puts the rows back in year order. ClustalW writes its output in
guide-tree order, and the viewer draws the rows in the order the file gives
them, so without the rewrite the first row is a 2013 strain.

[![](../media/flu-drift-alignment.png)](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/#data=%7B%22msaview%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22MsaView%22%2C%22height%22%3A640%2C%22treeAreaWidth%22%3A210%2C%22colWidth%22%3A2.2%2C%22rowHeight%22%3A16%2C%22colorSchemeName%22%3A%22clustalx_protein_dynamic%22%2C%22msaFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fh3n2%2Fh3n2-ha.aln%22%7D%7D%7D)

The 25 hemagglutinins in year order, 1968 at the top and 2022 at the bottom.
Every record is 566 residues, and the alignment is 567 columns wide, because
A/Victoria/3/1975 carries one extra residue near the end of the signal peptide.

## 4. A tree, and a date check

Biopython builds the distance matrix and the neighbor-joining tree, and the tree
carries no year.

```python
msa = MultipleSeqAlignment([aligned[row] for row in strains.row])
tree = DistanceTreeConstructor().nj(DistanceCalculator("blosum62").get_distance(msa))
tree.root_with_outgroup(strains.row[0])
Phylo.write(tree, "h3n2-ha.nh", "newick")
```

A tree built from sequences alone can be checked against the dates the sequences
came with. Distance from the 1968 root should grow with the year:

```python
depth = tree.depths()
distance = [depth[t] for t in tree.get_terminals()]
year = [int(t.name.split("_")[0]) for t in tree.get_terminals()]
np.corrcoef(distance, year)[0, 1]
```

```
root-to-tip distance against year: r = 0.985
```

[![](../media/flu-drift-tree.png)](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/#data=%7B%22msaview%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22MsaView%22%2C%22height%22%3A640%2C%22treeAreaWidth%22%3A210%2C%22colWidth%22%3A2.2%2C%22rowHeight%22%3A16%2C%22colorSchemeName%22%3A%22clustalx_protein_dynamic%22%2C%22msaFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fh3n2%2Fh3n2-ha.aln%22%7D%2C%22treeFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fh3n2%2Fh3n2-ha.nh%22%7D%7D%7D)

The tree beside the alignment. The 1968 root is at the top, and the branch
lengths grow down the series.

## 5. Count the changes the alignment carries

The viewer's conservation track reads a column across all 25 rows at once. A
series that runs in time supports a different count: how often the letter
changed from one vaccine strain to the next.

```python
columns = np.array([list(str(aligned[row].seq)) for row in strains.row])
changes = (columns[:-1] != columns[1:]).sum(axis=0)
```

```
columns that never changed: 449 of 567
the busiest column changed 11 times
the 2022 strain matches the 1968 one in 479 of 567 columns
```

Four fifths of the columns hold the same letter from one strain to the next all
the way through, and the 2022 strain matches the 1968 one in 479 of the 567. The
`column_tracks` trait takes the counts as one bar per column:

```python
drift = {
    "id": "drift",
    "name": "Changes between consecutive strains",
    "kind": "bar",
    "values": changes,
    "max": int(changes.max()),
    "color": "#c0392b",
    "height": 60,
}
```

`values` takes a numpy array as it is.

## 6. Mark the antigenic sites and the fusion peptide

Antigenic site B is two stretches of HA1, 155 to 160 and 186 to 198, on the rim
of the receptor-binding site. The fusion peptide is the first 11 residues of
HA2, which insert into the endosome membrane. Both go in as highlights on the
1968 row, and the viewer projects a row's residues onto columns:

```python
SIGNAL, HA1_LENGTH = 16, 329
reference = strains.row[0]

def h3(position):
    """H3 numbering -> residue of the record, which counts the signal peptide."""
    return position + SIGNAL

bands = [
    {"row": reference, "start": h3(155), "end": h3(160), "label": "site B 155-160"},
    {"row": reference, "start": h3(186), "end": h3(198), "label": "site B 186-198"},
    {"row": reference, "start": h3(HA1_LENGTH + 1), "end": h3(HA1_LENGTH + 11),
     "label": "fusion peptide", "color": "rgba(0,120,255,0.18)"},
]
```

Everything so far goes into the widget in one call:

```python
from msaview import MSAView

view = MSAView(
    msa="h3n2-ha.aln",
    tree="h3n2-ha.nh",
    column_tracks=[drift],
    highlights=bands,
    relative_to=reference,
    col_width=2.2,
    row_height=16,
    height=700,
)
view
```

The drift track over the alignment, with `relative_to` drawing every row as its

## 7. Read the two regions

```python
residue_column = np.cumsum([c != "-" for c in str(aligned[reference].seq)])

def column_of(residue):
    return int(np.argmax(residue_column == residue))

site_b = [h3(p) for start, end in [(155, 160), (186, 198)] for p in range(start, end + 1)]
fusion = list(range(h3(HA1_LENGTH + 1), h3(HA1_LENGTH + 11) + 1))
def read(positions):
    at = [column_of(r) for r in positions]
    return ["".join(columns[i, at]) for i in range(len(strains))]

pd.DataFrame({
    "year": strains.year,
    "site B (155-160, 186-198)": read(site_b),
    "fusion peptide (HA2 1-11)": read(fusion),
})
```

The fusion peptide in the same alignment at the same resolution. The boxed
column is the one substitution the series carries there, a leucine in 1968 and
1972 and an isoleucine in the 23 strains after them.

## 8. The loop back to Python

The widget sets two traits from the browser. `clicked` holds the cell a click
pinned, and `viewport` holds the columns on screen:

```python
def show(change):
    cell = change["new"]
    if cell:
        print(cell["row"], cell["column"], cell["letter"])

view.observe(show, "clicked")
```

Both are 1-based, `column` counts every column of the alignment, and `residue`
counts the clicked row's own letters. A click on a column of the figure above
answers with the year, the column and the residue, which indexes straight back
into the DataFrame:

```python
view.observe(
    lambda change: display(
        pd.DataFrame({
            "year": strains.year,
            "letter": columns[:, change["new"]["column"] - 1],
        })
    ),
    "clicked",
)
```

Setting a trait redraws the widget in place and keeps its scroll and zoom, so a
cell that changes `view.color_scheme` or `view.highlights` restyles the view
above it.

## 9. Share the link

<!-- usage: web -->

The same layers go into a URL that opens the hosted alignment in the web viewer,
for a reader with no kernel:

```python
snapshot = {"msaview": {
    "type": "MsaView",
    "height": 560,
    "colWidth": 2.2,
    "rowHeight": 16,
    "colorSchemeName": "clustalx_protein_dynamic",
    "msaFilehandle": {"uri": "data/h3n2/h3n2-ha.aln"},
    "treeFilehandle": {"uri": "data/h3n2/h3n2-ha.nh"},
    "columnTracks": [{**drift, "values": changes.tolist()}],
    "highlights": bands,
}}
"https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/#data=" + urllib.parse.quote(
    json.dumps(snapshot, separators=(",", ":")), safe=""
)
```

```
the link is 3332 characters
```

`json.dumps` needs `changes.tolist()`, where the widget took the numpy array
whole.

<!-- usage: r -->

[ggmsaview](https://github.com/GMOD/ggmsaview) opens the same hosted alignment
and tree. `h3n2-layers.json` holds the drift counts and the three bands the
notebook computed, so R reads them rather than counting again:

```r
library(ggmsaview)
data <- "https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/data/h3n2/"
layers <- jsonlite::fromJSON(paste0(data, "h3n2-layers.json"))
drift <- layers$columnTracks
bands <- layers$highlights
w <- msaview(msa = paste0(data, "h3n2-ha.aln"),
    tree = paste0(data, "h3n2-ha.nh"),
    color_scheme = "clustalx_protein_dynamic") +
  geom_msa_track(drift$values[[1]], name = drift$name, id = drift$id,
    max = drift$max, color = drift$color, height = drift$height) +
  geom_msa_highlight(bands)
w
ggplot2::ggsave("flu-drift-share-r.png",
  msaview_plot(w, tracks = "drift"), width = 12, height = 7)
```

![](../media/flu-drift-share-r.png)

The 25 strains in tree order beside the drift track, its red bars tallest in HA1
between columns 150 and 250, where the two orange site B bands sit. The blue
band is the fusion peptide, under a stretch of columns with almost no changes.

<!-- /usage -->

## Reproduce it end to end

[`build_flu_drift.py`](https://github.com/GMOD/JBrowseMSA/blob/main/docs/tutorials/scripts/build_flu_drift.py)
runs the steps above in a plain Python process, without the widget:

1. It fetches the 25 HA0 records from NCBI in one request, aligns them with
   ClustalW, and puts the rows back in year order, since ClustalW writes them in
   guide-tree order.
2. It builds a neighbor-joining tree from the alignment's own distances, rooted
   on the 1968 strain, and correlates each strain's distance from the root with
   its year as a date check.
3. It counts how often each column changed from one strain to the next, and
   reads site B and the fusion peptide year by year.
4. It writes the drift track and the bands on the two regions as a layers file,
   and the `#data=` link that opens them over the hosted alignment.

It needs the tools under [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/JBrowseMSA/main/docs/tutorials/scripts/build_flu_drift.py
python build_flu_drift.py out/
```

The script writes `out/h3n2-ha.aln`, `out/h3n2-ha.nh` and
`out/h3n2-layers.json`, the files the links on this page open, and prints the
numbers quoted here.
