"""Build the files for docs/tutorials/influenza_surveillance_figure.md.

Fetch Nextstrain's H5N1 cattle-outbreak genome build, subsample it, and write
the three files the figure loads: the HA alignment (h5n1-ha.fa), the tree
(h5n1.nwk) and the row table (h5n1-rowdata.json). The download stays beside
them as a cache. Print every number the tutorial quotes.

  python3 build_influenza_surveillance_figure.py [outdir]

Needs: python3, standard library only.

The build is pinned to a dated snapshot, so a rerun writes the same files and
prints the same numbers as the page.

Two notes on what this build publishes:

* The per-segment GenoFLU lineage is one constellation here, B3.13 in every
  tip, because the build is the cattle outbreak and GenoFLU names a genotype by
  its eight segment lineages. The eight strips in the figure therefore read an
  amino-acid site per segment, picked below as the site whose minor state the
  most sampled tips carry, plus the metadata fields the build records per tip.
  The builds that do carry a per-segment lineage per tip, avian-flu/h5n1/<seg>/2y,
  are assembled from GISAID as well as GenBank, and the GISAID database access
  agreement does not allow the sequences to be redistributed, so this page
  stays on the GenBank-and-SRA build.
* The tree carries no bootstrap or posterior support. Nextstrain infers it with
  IQ-TREE and publishes divergence and inferred dates per node, so the Newick
  written here has no internal node labels.
