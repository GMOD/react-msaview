# A protein family from a list of accessions

Human _NLRP1_, an immune sensor, starts with about eighty residues, a pyrin
domain, that the mouse protein lacks. Aligning the two with their relatives puts
the shared domains in the same columns, and the pyrin domain's absence shows as
blank space in the rows without it. This page starts from twelve UniProt
accessions for _NLRP1_ and ends on a link that opens the twelve sequences
aligned, with the tree inferred from them and their Pfam domains drawn in the
alignment's coordinates. Four commands produce the three files.

## Prerequisites

- `curl`
- ClustalW, `apt install clustalw` on Debian or Ubuntu, `brew install clustal-w`
  on macOS. ClustalW both aligns and infers a tree, so this page needs no other
  aligner.
- [react-msaview-cli](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/cli),
  `npm install -g react-msaview-cli`, NodeJS v22+

## Where the data comes from

Twelve NLRP1 orthologs as UniProtKB holds them, with Pfam matches from InterPro
release 110.0. The commands below fetch these, so there is nothing to download
by hand.

- one protein sequence per accession, for example:
  https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9C000.fasta
- precomputed Pfam matches per accession, for example:
  https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/api/entry/pfam/protein/uniprot/Q9C000/

Both endpoints serve one protein per request, so the whole family takes twelve
requests to each.

## The family

_NLRP1_ is an inflammasome sensor. Every vertebrate ortholog shares the same
core in the same order: a NACHT nucleotide-binding domain, a winged helix, a
helical domain, then FIIND and CARD at the C terminus. The orthologs differ at
the N terminus, where primates carry a pyrin (PYD) death-fold domain and rodents
do not.

The proteins run from 1143 to 1537 residues, so residue 328 is a different place
in every row. Drawing the domains in each protein's own coordinates puts the
shared core in twelve different places; drawing them in the alignment's
coordinates puts it in one.

## 1. Name the rows

Write one accession per line, followed by the label you want down the side of
the viewer. The label becomes the FASTA defline, the tree tip, and the first
column of the domain GFF.

```
Q9C000	Human
H2QC06	Chimp
A0A1D5QWR0	Rhesus
A0A8I3MJ75	Dog
A0ABM3YGI7	Hedgehog
E1BNN6	Cow
K9IW94	Pig
A0A9L0RFW2	Horse
Q2LKU9	Mouse
D9I2G4	Rat
A0ABM2XMM7	Hamster
A0A386CAB9	Zebrafish
```

Save that as `accessions.tsv`. The separator is a tab, and a line starting with
`#` is a comment, so the file can carry its own notes about why each row is in
it.

## 2. Fetch the sequences

```bash
# read each accession and write one FASTA record named by its label, which is
# what the viewer draws down the side
while IFS=$'\t' read -r accession label; do
  printf '>%s\n' "$label" >> family.fasta
  curl -sf "https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/$accession.fasta" |
    tail -n +2 | tr -d '\n' >> family.fasta
  printf '\n' >> family.fasta
done < accessions.tsv
```

`tail -n +2` drops UniProt's own defline, which carries the accession, the
species and the protein name; `tr -d '\n'` unwraps the sequence onto one line.
Check what you got before aligning it:

```bash
awk '/^>/{name=$0; next}{print name, length($0)}' family.fasta
```

```
>Human 1473
>Chimp 1471
>Rhesus 1537
>Dog 1432
>Hedgehog 1360
>Cow 1410
>Pig 1294
>Horse 1465
>Mouse 1182
>Rat 1218
>Hamster 1143
>Zebrafish 1355
```

All twelve records have plausible lengths for a full-length _NLRP1_. A truncated
fragment or a stray isoform would show up here as an outlier length.

The viewer opens unaligned sequences as readily as an alignment, once every row
is the same length. Right-pad the shorter ones and `family.fasta` loads as a
block of twelve rows.

[![](../media/protein-family-sequences.png)](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/#data=%7B%22msaview%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22MsaView%22%2C%22height%22%3A360%2C%22treeAreaWidth%22%3A150%2C%22colWidth%22%3A0.76%2C%22colorSchemeName%22%3A%22clustalx_protein_dynamic%22%2C%22msaFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnlrp1-unaligned.aln%22%7D%7D%7D)

The twelve sequences before alignment, one row each, colored by residue. Every
row starts at residue 1 and stops at its own length, which is the ragged right
edge. The conservation track above them is near flat.

## 3. Align them

```bash
clustalw -INFILE=family.fasta -ALIGN -TYPE=PROTEIN \
  -OUTPUT=FASTA -OUTFILE=family.afa
```

The alignment takes under two seconds. ClustalW reports `Alignment Score 258590`
and 1666 columns, 129 more than the longest input, to make room for insertions.

ClustalW is a progressive aligner. It is fast and deterministic, needs no
configuration, and places the domain architecture below in the right columns.
For a figure about the phylogeny, use MAFFT or MUSCLE for the alignment and
IQ-TREE or RAxML for the tree.

[![](../media/protein-family-aligned.png)](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/#data=%7B%22msaview%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22MsaView%22%2C%22height%22%3A360%2C%22treeAreaWidth%22%3A150%2C%22colWidth%22%3A0.7%2C%22colorSchemeName%22%3A%22clustalx_protein_dynamic%22%2C%22msaFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnlrp1.aln%22%7D%7D%7D)

The same twelve after ClustalW, at 1666 columns. Vertical bands of color run
through every row where the aligner found the same residues, and the pale
stretches are gaps it inserted to keep them there. The conservation track has
structure now.

## 4. Infer a tree

```bash
# -TREE reads an existing alignment and writes neighbor-joining Newick
clustalw -INFILE=family.afa -TREE -TYPE=PROTEIN -OUTPUTTREE=phylip

# ClustalW wraps the Newick across many lines; the viewer wants one string
tr -d '[:space:]' < family.ph > family.nwk
```

Read the result before trusting it:

```
(((((Mouse:0.11672,Rat:0.11797):0.05644,Hamster:0.14779):0.05664,
Zebrafish:0.56540):0.02478,Hedgehog:0.22128):0.01141,...
```

Zebrafish sits inside the rodents. It should be the outgroup, and its branch
length is 0.56540 against 0.11 to 0.22 for everything else, the longest branch
in the tree by a factor of three. Neighbor joining pulls the longest branch
towards whichever other branch is longest (long-branch attraction). This page
uses the tree to order the rows; its topology is not a phylogenetic result.

With the tree open beside the alignment, the viewer draws the rows in tree
order.

[![](../media/protein-family-tree.png)](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/#data=%7B%22msaview%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22MsaView%22%2C%22height%22%3A400%2C%22treeAreaWidth%22%3A190%2C%22colWidth%22%3A0.7%2C%22colorSchemeName%22%3A%22clustalx_protein_dynamic%22%2C%22msaFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnlrp1.aln%22%7D%2C%22treeFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnlrp1.nh%22%7D%7D%7D)

The alignment with the ClustalW tree drawn beside it. The three primates are
adjacent rows and so are the three rodents, and Zebrafish is drawn next to the
rodents on the long branch that put it there.

Clicking a node in the tree collapses the clade under it into one triangle,
labelled with how many tips it holds, and hides those rows from the alignment.

[![](../media/protein-family-collapsed.png)](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/#data=%7B%22msaview%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22MsaView%22%2C%22height%22%3A320%2C%22treeAreaWidth%22%3A190%2C%22colWidth%22%3A0.7%2C%22collapsed%22%3A%5B%22node-0-0-1-0-2-0-3%22%5D%2C%22colorSchemeName%22%3A%22clustalx_protein_dynamic%22%2C%22msaFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnlrp1.aln%22%7D%2C%22treeFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnlrp1.nh%22%7D%7D%7D)

Mouse, Rat and Hamster collapsed into the triangle marked 3. Eleven rows are
drawn where there were twelve, and the columns of the rows that remain do not
move.

## 5. Ask InterPro what the domains are

InterPro precomputes matches for every UniProtKB sequence, so for accessions the
CLI looks them up:

```bash
react-msaview-cli interpro accessions.tsv -o family-domains.gff
```

```
InterPro release 110.0; reading precomputed pfam matches...
  [1/12] Q9C000: 9 pfam entries
  ...
12 fetched, 0 from /home/you/.cache/react-msaview-cli/interpro
```

The lookup takes four seconds for twelve proteins. The CLI writes the release
number into the GFF header, which pins the coordinates in the figures to one
InterPro version. A rerun reads from the disk cache and makes a single request.

The other command, `react-msaview-cli interproscan`, submits sequences to the
EBI job queue and waits about fifteen minutes. Use it for de novo assemblies or
predicted proteins that InterPro has never seen.

Count what came back before drawing it:

```bash
grep IPR004020 family-domains.gff | cut -f1
```

```
Human
Chimp
Rhesus
Dog
Hedgehog
```

Five rows out of twelve carry the PYD, at residues 9-83 in each.

## 6. Open the three files

<!-- usage: web -->

`family.afa`, `family.nwk` and `family-domains.gff` go in the alignment, tree
and annotation slots of the [import form](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/),
either as local files or as URLs. Each slot has a FILE and a URL toggle, and the
GFF slot is the one marked optional.

[![](../media/protein-family-domains.png)](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/#data=%7B%22msaview%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22MsaView%22%2C%22height%22%3A370%2C%22treeAreaWidth%22%3A150%2C%22colWidth%22%3A0.7%2C%22colorSchemeName%22%3A%22clustalx_protein_dynamic%22%2C%22msaFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnlrp1.aln%22%7D%2C%22treeFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnlrp1.nh%22%7D%2C%22gffFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnlrp1-domains.gff%22%7D%7D%7D)

All three files in one view. The domain boxes replace the residue colors: NACHT
first, the winged helix and the helical domain next to it, the leucine-rich
repeats scattered through the middle, then the two FIIND blocks and the CARD at
the right. Each of those spans one band of columns across all twelve rows. The
PYD at the far left is drawn on five rows, and the other seven are blank there.

The legend in the top right names every accession in the file, and **Settings →
Annotations** lists the same accessions with a checkbox each.

[![](../media/protein-family-filter.png)](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/#data=%7B%22msaview%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22MsaView%22%2C%22height%22%3A370%2C%22treeAreaWidth%22%3A150%2C%22colWidth%22%3A0.7%2C%22colorSchemeName%22%3A%22clustalx_protein_dynamic%22%2C%22msaFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnlrp1.aln%22%7D%2C%22treeFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnlrp1.nh%22%7D%2C%22gffFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnlrp1-domains.gff%22%7D%7D%7D)

The Settings panel beside the view it filters, one checkbox per InterPro
accession. IPR004020, the pyrin domain, has 5 matches in the GFF where NACHT,
the winged helix, the helical domain and the CARD each have 12. IPR025307 has 24
because it matches twice in every row, once as FIIND and once as the UPA-FIIND
block beside it.

<!-- usage: r -->

[ggmsaview](https://github.com/GMOD/ggmsaview) takes the same three files as the
alignment, tree and annotation arguments of `msaview()`, as paths or URLs. `w`
alone opens the viewer in RStudio or a notebook, and `msaview_plot()` draws the
same view as a ggplot2 figure:

```r
library(ggmsaview)
w <- msaview(
  msa = "https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/data/nlrp1.aln",
  tree = "https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/data/nlrp1.nh",
  gff = "https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/data/nlrp1-domains.gff",
  color_scheme = "clustalx_protein_dynamic"
)
w
ggplot2::ggsave("protein-family-domains-r.png", msaview_plot(w),
  width = 12, height = 5)
```

![](../media/protein-family-domains-r.png)

The twelve rows over 1,666 columns with the GFF's domains as filled boxes and
one legend entry per domain name. NACHT, the winged helix, the helical domain,
the two FIIND blocks and the CARD each cover all twelve rows, the leucine-rich
repeats fall in short runs through the middle, and the PYD at the far left
covers five rows. Conservation and property conservation run above.

<!-- /usage -->

## Rows with the pyrin domain

Unchecking everything except IPR004020 leaves only the pyrin domain on screen.

[![](../media/protein-family-pyd-only.png)](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/#data=%7B%22msaview%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22MsaView%22%2C%22height%22%3A370%2C%22treeAreaWidth%22%3A150%2C%22colWidth%22%3A0.7%2C%22colorSchemeName%22%3A%22clustalx_protein_dynamic%22%2C%22turnedOffFeatures%22%3A%7B%22IPR001315%22%3Atrue%2C%22IPR001611%22%3Atrue%2C%22IPR007111%22%3Atrue%2C%22IPR025307%22%3Atrue%2C%22IPR041075%22%3Atrue%2C%22IPR041267%22%3Atrue%7D%2C%22msaFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnlrp1.aln%22%7D%2C%22treeFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnlrp1.nh%22%7D%2C%22gffFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnlrp1-domains.gff%22%7D%7D%7D)

The overlay reduced to the pyrin domain. The three primates carry it as one
block of rows, Dog carries it in the row right under them, and Hedgehog carries
it in the last row of the frame. Cow, Pig and Horse sit between those two
without it.

## Domain coordinates and columns

The NACHT domain is annotated in all twelve rows, and InterPro reports it at a
different residue in each:

```bash
grep IPR007111 family-domains.gff | cut -f1,4,5
```

```
Human	328	497
Chimp	328	497
Rhesus	332	501
Dog	299	467
Hedgehog	296	465
Cow	294	463
Pig	162	330
Horse	328	493
Mouse	134	301
Rat	176	344
Hamster	93	258
Zebrafish	258	428
```

Human 328 and Hamster 93 are 235 residues apart. In the viewer, Human, Chimp,
Rhesus, Dog, Hedgehog, Cow, Pig and Horse all begin that domain in column 371,
and Mouse, Rat, Hamster and Zebrafish begin it in column 372, because the
overlay projects each row's residue coordinates through that row's own gaps
before drawing. The same projection draws the PYD in one place in the five rows
that carry it, and the seven rows without it are empty there.

## Missing annotations

Cow, Hedgehog and Zebrafish have no leucine-rich repeats called at all, where
Human has three and Rhesus four:

```bash
grep IPR001611 family-domains.gff | cut -f1 | sort | uniq -c
```

```
      2 Chimp
      2 Dog
      1 Hamster
      2 Horse
      3 Human
      1 Mouse
      3 Pig
      2 Rat
      4 Rhesus
```

A region that draws blank can mean the protein has none, or that nobody
annotated the ones it has. Several of these rows are unreviewed entries whose
gene models under-call. At whole-protein scale the two look identical; at base
resolution a row with residues under an unannotated stretch looks different from
a row that is gap there.

[![](../media/protein-family-closeup.png)](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/#data=%7B%22msaview%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22MsaView%22%2C%22height%22%3A520%2C%22treeAreaWidth%22%3A150%2C%22colWidth%22%3A14%2C%22rowHeight%22%3A20%2C%22scrollX%22%3A-476%2C%22colorSchemeName%22%3A%22clustalx_protein_dynamic%22%2C%22msaFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnlrp1.aln%22%7D%2C%22treeFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnlrp1.nh%22%7D%2C%22gffFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnlrp1-domains.gff%22%7D%7D%7D)

The left edge of the PYD block at one letter per column. The five rows with the
domain are green. Cow fills all 75 of those columns with residues and carries no
pyrin domain over them; Horse fills 73 of them. Mouse, Rat and Hamster are
mostly dashes there, and Hamster has 24 residues in the 75 columns.

## Share the view

A file you opened from your own computer travels inside the page URL, and an
alignment this size does not fit, so the header says **Not in the link**. Put
the three files on a server that sends them over HTTPS with CORS (a GitHub repo
through `raw.githubusercontent.com` works), and name the URLs instead:

```json
{
  "msaview": {
    "type": "MsaView",
    "colWidth": 0.7,
    "colorSchemeName": "clustalx_protein_dynamic",
    "msaFilehandle": { "uri": "https://example.org/family.afa" },
    "treeFilehandle": { "uri": "https://example.org/family.nwk" },
    "gffFilehandle": { "uri": "https://example.org/family-domains.gff" },
    "highlights": [{ "start": 39, "end": 113, "label": "PYD, Pfam PF02758" }]
  }
}
```

URL-encode that and append it to the app as `#data=`. The link carries the
addresses of the files, so it works at any size. The optional `highlights` takes
1-based inclusive columns and puts the PYD band in the link.

[![](../media/protein-family-link.png)](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/#data=%7B%22msaview%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22MsaView%22%2C%22height%22%3A370%2C%22treeAreaWidth%22%3A150%2C%22colWidth%22%3A0.7%2C%22colorSchemeName%22%3A%22clustalx_protein_dynamic%22%2C%22highlights%22%3A%5B%7B%22start%22%3A39%2C%22end%22%3A113%2C%22label%22%3A%22PYD%2C%20Pfam%20PF02758%22%7D%5D%2C%22msaFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnlrp1.aln%22%7D%2C%22treeFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnlrp1.nh%22%7D%2C%22gffFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnlrp1-domains.gff%22%7D%7D%7D)

What that link opens: the three hosted files, and columns 39 to 113 banded and
labelled PYD across all twelve rows.

## Reproduce it end to end

[`build_protein_family.sh`](https://github.com/GMOD/JBrowseMSA/blob/main/docs/tutorials/scripts/build_protein_family.sh)
runs the four commands above in order:

1. It fetches one sequence per accession from UniProt and names each FASTA
   record by its label, since the label is what the viewer draws down the side.
2. ClustalW aligns the records and infers a neighbor-joining tree from the
   alignment.
3. `react-msaview-cli interpro` reads InterPro's precomputed Pfam matches for
   the same accessions and writes them as a GFF, each domain in its own
   protein's residue numbering.

It needs the tools under [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/JBrowseMSA/main/docs/tutorials/scripts/build_protein_family.sh
bash build_protein_family.sh
```

With no arguments the script writes the accession list above and builds all
three files beside it. Point it at your own list to do the same for another
family:

```bash
bash build_protein_family.sh my-accessions.tsv out/
```
