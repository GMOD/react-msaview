# Reading cross-reactivity off the kinase pocket

Imatinib was designed against one kinase, BCR-ABL1, and also inhibits half a
dozen others (KIT, PDGFRA, CSF1R, LCK) well enough to matter clinically. Every
human kinase folds the same ATP-binding pocket around the same three landmarks,
so a drug built to fit one kinase's pocket often fits several. Across the human
kinase family, we:

- list the kinases and fetch their sequences
- align the kinase domain to Pfam's HMM and build a tree
- find the landmark columns from ABL1 and band them over a sequence logo
- compare the gatekeeper residue between imatinib's targets and the CDKs
- check the gatekeeper tally against KLIFS

## Prerequisites

- `curl`
- `python3`
- docker, to run HMMER and FastTree as biocontainers
  (`quay.io/biocontainers/hmmer`, `quay.io/biocontainers/fasttree`); both are
  also on `apt` and `brew`

## The data

UniProt supplies the kinase list and the sequences, and InterPro serves Pfam's
kinase domain model. Nothing to download: the build script fetches these.

</details>

## 1. List the human kinases

UniProt's `pkinfam.txt` groups every human and mouse protein kinase by family. A
few lines of Python keep the human entries and their groups:

```python
import re

lines = open('pkinfam.txt').read().splitlines()
group = None
rows = []
i, n = 0, len(lines)
while i < n:
    line = lines[i]
    if re.fullmatch(r'=+', line.strip()) and i + 2 < n and re.fullmatch(r'=+', lines[i + 2].strip()):
        group = lines[i + 1].strip()
        i += 3
        continue
    m = re.match(r'^(\S+)\s+(\S+_HUMAN)\s+\((\w+)\s*\)', line)
    if m:
        gene, entry, acc = m.groups()
        rows.append((gene, acc, group))
    i += 1
print(len(rows))
```

```
512
```

The 512 entries fall in ten named groups (AGC, CAMK, CK1, CMGC, NEK, RGC, STE,
TKL, Tyr, Other) plus six small "Atypical" families with a different fold. This
page writes `Tyr`, the tyrosine kinases with ABL1 among them, as `TK`.

## 2. Fetch the sequences

The script fetches one UniProt sequence per accession, 50 accessions per
request:

```python
import urllib.parse
import urllib.request

query = ' OR '.join(f'accession:{a}' for a in accessions[:50])
url = 'https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/stream?query=' + urllib.parse.quote(query) + '&format=fasta'
with urllib.request.urlopen(url) as resp:
    fasta_text = resp.read().decode()
```

The requests return 512 full-length records for the 512 accessions.

## 3. Align the kinase domain

`hmmalign` against Pfam's Pkinase model (PF00069) extracts the catalytic domain,
leaving the regulatory regions, SH2/SH3 modules and transmembrane spans behind,
and puts every copy in the same 262 columns:

```bash
curl -sf "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/api/entry/pfam/PF00069/?annotation=hmm" |
  gzip -dc > pf00069.hmm

# score every candidate first, and keep only what clears Pfam's own gathering
# threshold. That drops the atypical, non-ePK-fold kinases (PI3/PI4-kinase,
# ADCK, alpha-type...) that would otherwise align to noise
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work quay.io/biocontainers/hmmer:3.4--h7d74f8d_5 \
  hmmsearch --cut_ga --tblout hmmsearch.tbl -o hmmsearch.out pf00069.hmm all.fasta

docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work quay.io/biocontainers/hmmer:3.4--h7d74f8d_5 \
  hmmalign --trim --outformat afa -o kinase.afa pf00069.hmm kept.fasta
```

474 of the 512 entries clear the gathering threshold, and 30 of the 38 dropped
belong to the six "Atypical" families. `--trim` removes the unaligned tails, and
a following step strips the lowercase insert-state characters `hmmalign` leaves,
so all 474 rows come out at the HMM's 262 columns.

[![](../media/kinase-pocket-family.png)](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/#data=%7B%22msaview%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22MsaView%22%2C%22height%22%3A960%2C%22treeAreaWidth%22%3A110%2C%22colWidth%22%3A4.6%2C%22rowHeight%22%3A2%2C%22drawLabels%22%3Afalse%2C%22colorSchemeName%22%3A%22clustalx_protein_dynamic%22%2C%22msaFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fkinase-pocket%2Fkinase-pocket.afa%22%7D%2C%22treeFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fkinase-pocket%2Fkinase-pocket.nwk%22%7D%2C%22treeMetadataFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fkinase-pocket%2Fkinase-pocket-metadata.json%22%7D%7D%7D)

All 474 kinase domains beside their tree, with vertical bands at the columns the
kinases share and ragged stretches at loops that differ from kinase to kinase.

## 4. Build a tree

FastTree builds the tree:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work quay.io/biocontainers/fasttree:2.2.0--h7b50bb2_1 \
  FastTree kinase-pocket.afa > kinase-pocket.nwk
```

```
Total time: 13.70 seconds  Unique: 474/474  Bad splits: 0/471
```

Clicking a tip opens a dialog with that row's UniProt accession and kinase group
from `kinase-pocket-metadata.json`.

## 5. Find the pocket landmarks

The ATP pocket has three landmarks: a catalytic lysine that anchors ATP's
phosphates, a gatekeeper that sets the room in the back pocket, and a DFG motif
that switches the kinase between active and inactive states. In ABL1 numbering
they are K271, T315 and D381-F382-G383, so walking the ABL1 row gives each
landmark's column:

```python
full_abl1 = uniprot_sequence[metadata['ABL1']['uniprot']]
aligned_abl1 = alignment['ABL1']
residues = [(col, c) for col, c in enumerate(aligned_abl1, 1) if c != '-']
pos = full_abl1.find(''.join(c for _, c in residues[:8]))
abl1_number = {}
for col, c in residues:
    pos = full_abl1.index(c, pos)
    abl1_number[col] = pos + 1
    pos += 1
```

`alignment` and `uniprot_sequence` map a kinase's name and accession to its
sequence, and `metadata` is `kinase-pocket-metadata.json`. The script prints:

```
ABL1: 1130 aa, 262 alignment columns
catalytic K: column 30, ABL1 K271
gatekeeper: column 77, ABL1 T315
DFG: column 141-143, ABL1 D381 F382 G383
```

Column 102, outside the pocket, is the control:

The sequence logo over the alignment, with the catalytic K (blue), gatekeeper
(red), DFG (green) and control (grey) columns banded. The catalytic lysine
column is 93.5% K, and the control column, between the gatekeeper and the DFG
motif, has no majority residue: F is the most common at 13.3%, then S, K, R, L
and H.

<!-- usage: r -->

[ggmsaview](https://github.com/GMOD/ggmsaview) reads the same hosted alignment
and tree, and `geom_msa_highlight()` takes the four columns as a data frame. `w`
opens the viewer in RStudio or a notebook, and `msaview_plot()` draws the logo
above the rows as a ggplot2 figure:

```r
library(ggmsaview)
pocket <- data.frame(
  start = c(30, 77, 141, 102),
  end = c(30, 77, 143, 102),
  label = c("catalytic K", "gatekeeper", "DFG", "control"),
  color = c("#1565c040", "#e3242b40", "#2e7d3240", "#75757540")
)
w <- msaview(
  msa = "https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/data/kinase-pocket/kinase-pocket.afa",
  tree = "https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/data/kinase-pocket/kinase-pocket.nwk",
  color_scheme = "clustalx_protein_dynamic", row_height = 2
) + geom_msa_highlight(pocket)
w
ggplot2::ggsave("kinase-pocket-logo-r.png",
  msaview_plot(w, tracks = c("conservation", "sequence-logo")),
  width = 12, height = 8)
```

![](../media/kinase-pocket-logo-r.png)

All 474 rows over the 262 Pkinase columns, the tree beside them, under the
conservation bars and the sequence logo. The logo stands tall at the catalytic
K, at the DFG motif and in the HRD loop before it, and stays low at the control
column. `row_height = 2` leaves room in the figure for the tracks.

<!-- /usage -->

```python
def tally(col, top):
    counts = Counter(row[col - 1] for row in alignment.values())
    return ', '.join(f'{r} {n} ({100 * n / total:.1f}%)' for r, n in counts.most_common(top))

print(f'catalytic K, column 30 over {total} rows: {tally(30, 3)}')
print(f'control, column 102: {tally(102, 8)}')
```

```
catalytic K, column 30 over 474 rows: K 443 (93.5%), - 15 (3.2%), C 4 (0.8%)
control, column 102: F 63 (13.3%), S 50 (10.5%), K 49 (10.3%), R 46 (9.7%), L 30 (6.3%), H 29 (6.1%), Y 27 (5.7%), D 26 (5.5%)
```

## 6. Compare the gatekeeper across two families

A small gatekeeper (threonine) leaves the back pocket open, and a bulkier one
(phenylalanine, methionine, leucine) fills it. Two bands of the tree show column
77: the ABL band, and the CDK band, a family imatinib does not inhibit:

[![](../media/kinase-pocket-gatekeeper-abl.png)](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/#data=%7B%22msaview%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22MsaView%22%2C%22height%22%3A280%2C%22treeAreaWidth%22%3A160%2C%22colWidth%22%3A34%2C%22rowHeight%22%3A46%2C%22colorSchemeName%22%3A%22clustalx_protein_dynamic%22%2C%22turnedOffTracks%22%3A%7B%22conservation%22%3Atrue%2C%22property-conservation%22%3Atrue%7D%2C%22scrollX%22%3A-2312%2C%22scrollY%22%3A-4646%2C%22msaFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fkinase-pocket%2Fkinase-pocket.afa%22%7D%2C%22treeFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fkinase-pocket%2Fkinase-pocket.nwk%22%7D%2C%22treeMetadataFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fkinase-pocket%2Fkinase-pocket-metadata.json%22%7D%7D%7D)

The gatekeeper column in the ABL band, where ABL1, ABL2 and CSK read threonine
and MATK methionine.

[![](../media/kinase-pocket-gatekeeper-cdk.png)](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/#data=%7B%22msaview%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22MsaView%22%2C%22height%22%3A320%2C%22treeAreaWidth%22%3A160%2C%22colWidth%22%3A34%2C%22rowHeight%22%3A46%2C%22colorSchemeName%22%3A%22clustalx_protein_dynamic%22%2C%22turnedOffTracks%22%3A%7B%22conservation%22%3Atrue%2C%22property-conservation%22%3Atrue%7D%2C%22scrollX%22%3A-2312%2C%22scrollY%22%3A-12006%2C%22msaFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fkinase-pocket%2Fkinase-pocket.afa%22%7D%2C%22treeFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fkinase-pocket%2Fkinase-pocket.nwk%22%7D%2C%22treeMetadataFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fkinase-pocket%2Fkinase-pocket-metadata.json%22%7D%7D%7D)

The gatekeeper column in the CDK band, where CDK1, CDK2 and CDK3 read
phenylalanine, as do the flanking CDK16 and CDK17.

The script prints the residue each named kinase has in this column:

```
ABL1=T ABL2=T KIT=T PDGFRA=T CSF1R=T LCK=T
MATK=M CSK=T
CDK1=F CDK2=F CDK3=F CDK16=F CDK17=F
```

## 7. Check the gatekeeper against KLIFS

The script tallies the gatekeeper column across all 474 rows:

```python
counts = Counter(row[76] for row in alignment.values())  # column 77, 0-indexed
for r, n in counts.most_common(5):
    print(f'{r}  {n:3d}  {100 * n / total:.1f}%')
```

```
M  185  39.0%
T   90  19.0%
L   76  16.0%
F   69  14.6%
V   15  3.2%
```

Threonine is the gatekeeper in 19.0% of these human kinase domains. KLIFS, which
curates an 85-residue pocket from solved structures, puts the same position at
18.4% threonine over its 521 human kinase entries. KLIFS' terms do not allow
redistribution, so the script queries its API live
(`https://klifs.net/api/kinase_information?species=Human`) and prints
`KLIFS: 96 of 521 human pockets read T at residue 45 (18.4%)`.

## Reproduce it end to end

[`build_kinase_pocket.sh`](https://github.com/GMOD/JBrowseMSA/blob/main/docs/tutorials/scripts/build_kinase_pocket.sh)
runs the steps above in order:

1. It reads UniProt's kinase classification, keeps the human entries with their
   groups, and fetches their sequences.
2. HMMER keeps the sequences that clear Pfam's Pkinase gathering threshold and
   aligns their kinase domains to the HMM's 262 columns.
3. FastTree infers a tree, and the script writes each kinase's group and UniProt
   accession as row metadata.
4. It prints the landmark columns, the logo shares and the gatekeeper tally,
   then queries KLIFS for the closing comparison.

It needs the tools under [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/JBrowseMSA/main/docs/tutorials/scripts/build_kinase_pocket.sh
bash build_kinase_pocket.sh
```

With no arguments the script writes `kinase-pocket.afa`, `kinase-pocket.nwk` and
`kinase-pocket-metadata.json` in the working directory.
