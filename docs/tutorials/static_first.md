# An alignment on your own page, static first

A web page that mounts the viewer as it loads asks every reader for 452 KB of
gzipped JavaScript before the first residue draws, including a reader who only
scrolls past. A page that shows the first frame as an SVG and loads the viewer
on request sends 8 KB instead. For the NLRP1 family that
[A protein family from a list of accessions](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/tutorials/protein_family)
builds, we:

- write one props file for both views
- draw the first frame as an SVG
- put the SVG on a page and load the viewer on a click or on scroll
- measure both pages with Lighthouse
- check that the swap moves nothing on the page

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or later, which brings the `npx` that fetches react-msaview-cli,
  serve and Lighthouse: `apt install nodejs`, or `brew install node`
- Chrome or Chromium, for Lighthouse in step 6: `apt install chromium`, or
  `brew install --cask google-chrome`

## The data

The twelve NLRP1 orthologs, their ClustalW tree and their InterPro 110.0 domain
matches, as the protein family tutorial writes them. Nothing to download: the
CLI and the viewer fetch these by URL from the props file of step 1.

## 1. Write one props file for both views

The CLI reads `MSAViewer` props through `--props` and the viewer through
`mount()`, so one JSON file describes both the figure and the live view. Save
this as `nlrp1.json`:

```json
{
  "msaUrl": "https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/data/nlrp1.aln",
  "treeUrl": "https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/data/nlrp1.nh",
  "gffUrl": "https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/data/nlrp1-domains.gff",
  "height": 360,
  "hideHeader": true
}
```

`height` is the viewer's full height in pixels, tracks included, and
`hideHeader` leaves out the toolbar. Any prop but a callback can go in the file,
and [Embedding](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/embedding) lists them.

## 2. Draw the first frame with the CLI

```bash
npx react-msaview-cli@9.1.1 export-svg --props nlrp1.json --viewport --width 900 -o nlrp1.svg
```

The CLI fetches the three files and draws the view 900 by 360 pixels with no
browser. `--viewport` limits the drawing to the frame the viewer opens on, where
the default is all 1666 columns. The build script printed a 1111 by 304 SVG of
118,981 bytes, 6,618 gzipped.

[![](../media/static_first-svg.png)](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/data/static_first/nlrp1.svg)

The first 61 columns of the twelve rows under the Conservation and Property
conservation tracks. The PAAD/DAPIN/Pyrin domain fills the cells green from
column 39 in Chimp, Human, Rhesus, Dog and Hedgehog. The domain legend in a
panel at the right makes the SVG 1111 pixels wide.

## 3. Put the figure on the page

The page shows the SVG, with a button over its corner, in a box as tall as the
live view: the props' 360 pixels for the viewer and 5 for the divider under it.

```html
<style>
  .msa-embed {
    position: relative;
    max-width: 900px;
    height: 365px;
  }
  .msa-embed > img {
    display: block;
    max-width: 100%;
    max-height: 100%;
  }
  .msa-explore {
    position: absolute;
    right: 8px;
    bottom: 8px;
  }
</style>

<div class="msa-embed" data-props="nlrp1.json">
  <img
    src="nlrp1.svg"
    alt="Twelve NLRP1 orthologs aligned under their tree, with the PAAD/DAPIN/Pyrin domain filled green"
  />
  <button type="button" class="msa-explore">Explore the alignment</button>
</div>
```

- The box keeps its 365 pixels when the viewer replaces the image, so the text
  under it stays put.
- `max-width: 100%` scales the SVG to the box, and on a phone to the screen:
  Lighthouse's mobile run drew it 396 pixels wide.
- The rules name `.msa-explore` and `.msa-embed > img`, because a rule on
  `.msa-embed button` also reaches the viewer's own buttons and stacks its track
  menus in the Explore button's corner.

[![](../media/static_first-page.png)](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/data/static_first/index.html)

The page as it loads: a heading, the SVG scaled to the 900-pixel box, the
Explore button in its lower right corner, and a paragraph under the box. The
page has fetched 8 KB and no JavaScript file.

## 4. Load the viewer on a click

<!-- usage: web -->

On the reader's click, the script fetches the bundle and the props, empties the
box and mounts the viewer into it:

```js
const bundle = 'https://unpkg.com/react-msaview@9.1.1/bundle/index.js'
let bundleLoaded

function loadBundle() {
  bundleLoaded ??= new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const script = document.createElement('script')
    script.src = bundle
    script.onload = resolve
    script.onerror = () => {
      script.remove()
      bundleLoaded = undefined
      reject(new Error('the viewer bundle did not load'))
    }
    document.head.append(script)
  })
  return bundleLoaded
}

async function explore(box) {
  const button = box.querySelector('.msa-explore')
  button.disabled = true
  button.textContent = 'Loading…'
  try {
    const [props] = await Promise.all([
      fetch(box.dataset.props).then(res => res.json()),
      loadBundle(),
    ])
    box.replaceChildren()
    window.ReactMSAView.mount(box, props)
  } catch {
    button.disabled = false
    button.textContent = 'Explore the alignment (retry)'
  }
}

for (const box of document.querySelectorAll('.msa-embed')) {
  box.querySelector('.msa-explore').addEventListener('click', () => {
    explore(box)
  })
}
```

`loadBundle` keeps one promise, so a page with several boxes downloads the
bundle once. A failed download drops the promise and re-enables the button, so
the next click tries again.

[![](../media/static_first-explore.png)](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/data/static_first/index.html)

The page of step 3 after the click, with the viewer filling the box: the
minimap, the two tracks with their menus, the tree, the twelve rows and the
domain legend. The paragraph under the box has not moved.

<!-- usage: r -->

[ggmsaview](https://github.com/GMOD/ggmsaview) gives an R Markdown or Quarto
page the same two forms: a chunk that prints `msaview_plot(w)` puts a ggplot2
PNG on the page, and one that prints `w` puts the widget, bundle included:

```r
library(ggmsaview)
w <- msaview(
  msa = "https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/data/nlrp1.aln",
  tree = "https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/data/nlrp1.nh",
  gff = "https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/data/nlrp1-domains.gff"
)
w
ggplot2::ggsave("static_first-r.png", msaview_plot(w), width = 10, height = 4)
```

![](../media/static_first-r.png)

The whole family as a ggplot2 figure: the tree, the two conservation tracks over
all 1666 columns, and each row's domains as boxes, with PAAD/DAPIN/Pyrin in
Chimp, Human, Rhesus, Dog and Hedgehog alone.

<!-- /usage -->

## 5. Load the viewer when the figure scrolls into view

To start the download as the box nears the viewport, replace the click handler
of step 4 with this loop:

```js
const nearby = new IntersectionObserver(
  entries => {
    for (const entry of entries) {
      if (entry.isIntersecting) {
        nearby.unobserve(entry.target)
        explore(entry.target)
      }
    }
  },
  { rootMargin: '200px' },
)
for (const box of document.querySelectorAll('.msa-embed')) {
  nearby.observe(box)
}
```

The capture script for this page's figures serves the page with the box 2000
pixels down and counts the requests for the bundle:

```text
scroll page at load: 0 bundle requests
scroll page after scrolling: 1 bundle requests
```

## 6. Measure both pages

`live.html` is the same page with the bundle in a deferred script tag and the
viewer mounted as the page loads. The build script serves both pages gzipped and
runs Lighthouse's mobile profile, an emulated mid-range phone on slow 4G, over
each:

```bash
npx serve@14.2.6 -l 8123 . &
npx lighthouse@13.5.0 http://localhost:8123/ --only-categories=performance --throttling-method=devtools
npx lighthouse@13.5.0 http://localhost:8123/live --only-categories=performance --throttling-method=devtools
```

| Lighthouse, mobile       | `index.html`     | `live.html`           |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Bytes transferred        | 8 KB             | 455 KB                |
| Speed Index              | 1115 ms          | 4810 ms               |
| Largest contentful paint | 1407 ms, the SVG | 635 ms, the paragraph |
| Total blocking time      | 73 ms            | 837 ms                |
| Cumulative layout shift  | 0                | 0                     |

Speed Index counts the viewer's canvases and largest contentful paint does not,
so on `live.html` the latter records the paragraph under the box, which paints
seconds before the alignment. The times vary by a few hundred milliseconds from
run to run.

## 7. Check the swap

The capture script prints the box's height and the top of the paragraph under it
before and after the click:

```text
before the click: box 365 px, paragraph at 460.875 px
after the click: box 365 px, paragraph at 460.875 px
```

Lighthouse's layout shift of 0 covers the image arriving and the viewer mounting
as each page loads, and the lines above cover the click. The SVG and the live
view also open on the same columns: both start at column 1, where Horse is the
one row with a residue, with the green PAAD/DAPIN/Pyrin cells at the same column
in the same five rows.

## Reproduce it end to end

[`build_static_first.sh`](https://github.com/GMOD/JBrowseMSA/blob/main/docs/tutorials/scripts/build_static_first.sh)
runs the commands above in order:

1. It writes the props file naming the NLRP1 alignment, tree and domains by URL.
2. It draws the first frame with `react-msaview-cli export-svg` and prints the
   SVG's size beside the bundle's.
3. It writes `index.html`, which loads the viewer on a click, and `live.html`,
   which loads it as the page loads.
4. It serves both pages gzipped and runs Lighthouse's mobile profile over each.

It needs the tools under [Prerequisites](#prerequisites). Set `CHROME_PATH` when
Lighthouse does not find Chrome on its own.

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/JBrowseMSA/main/docs/tutorials/scripts/build_static_first.sh
bash build_static_first.sh out/
```

The script writes the four hosted files into `out/` and prints the numbers
quoted here.
