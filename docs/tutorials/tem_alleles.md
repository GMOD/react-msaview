# TEM beta-lactamase alleles and what they hydrolyze

NCBI's Reference Gene Catalog names 233 TEM beta-lactamase alleles, many with a
phenotype: broad-spectrum or extended-spectrum, each with or without inhibitor
resistance. The 286-residue proteins differ from TEM-1 by a few substitutions,
four of which the literature ties to extended-spectrum activity and three to
inhibitor resistance. For 46 alleles, we:

- align them and infer a tree
- give each row its phenotype and its residue at seven named positions
- draw the positions as strips and as bands
- compare the two groups of positions against a control
- open the result from one link

## Prerequisites

- `curl`
- ClustalW, `apt install clustalw` on Debian or Ubuntu, `brew install clustal-w`
  on macOS. ClustalW both aligns and infers a tree, so this page needs no other
  aligner.
- python3, standard library only

## The data

Two files of the AMRFinderPlus database, and four this page writes from them.
The build script fetches the two. Nothing to download.

## 1. Pick the alleles

The catalog's `product_name` holds the phenotype and its `gene_family` column is
`blaTEM`, so the selection takes the twelve lowest-numbered alleles of each
phenotype:

```python
number = re.fullmatch(r'blaTEM-(\d+)', row['allele'])
phenotype = row['product_name'].split(' class A')[0]
if not number or phenotype not in PHENOTYPES:
    continue
candidates[phenotype].append((int(number.group(1)), row))
```

```
broad-spectrum: 16 alleles in the catalog, 12 kept
extended-spectrum: 83 alleles in the catalog, 12 kept
inhibitor-resistant broad-spectrum: 30 alleles in the catalog, 12 kept
inhibitor-resistant extended-spectrum: 10 alleles in the catalog, 10 kept
46 alleles selected, lengths 285 aa x 1, 286 aa x 45
```

The 94 TEM alleles whose product name is a plain `class A beta-lactamase`, with
no phenotype, stay out.

## 2. Align and infer a tree

```bash
clustalw -INFILE=tem.fasta -ALIGN -TYPE=PROTEIN -OUTORDER=INPUT \
  -OUTPUT=FASTA -OUTFILE=tem.afa
clustalw -INFILE=tem.afa -TREE -TYPE=PROTEIN -OUTPUTTREE=phylip
tr -d '[:space:]' < tem.ph > tem.nwk
```

```
46 rows, 286 alignment columns
```

One column per residue of TEM-1. TEM-178 is the only allele of another length,
at 285 residues, and its deletion is the alignment's one gap.

Forty-six alleles beside the tree ClustalW inferred from them, with the 31
varying positions as white and off-color specks in otherwise single-colored
columns.

## 3. Write the row table

Each row gets its phenotype and its residue at the seven positions of step 4,
keyed by allele name:

```python
record = {'phenotype': phenotype[row], 'subclass': subclass[row]}
for position in fields:
    record[f'Ambler {position}'] = aligned[row][ambler_column[position]]
```

```
wrote ./tem-rowdata.json: 46 rows, 10 fields, 11 kB
```

Eleven kilobytes percent-encode past 8,000 characters, so the snapshot names the
file instead and the viewer fetches it at startup:

```json
{
  "type": "MsaView",
  "msaFilehandle": { "uri": "https://example.org/tem.afa" },
  "treeFilehandle": { "uri": "https://example.org/tem.nwk" },
  "treeMetadataFilehandle": { "uri": "https://example.org/tem-rowdata.json" },
  "encodings": [{ "channel": "tipLabel", "field": "phenotype" }]
}
```

The `tipLabel` channel reading the phenotype field: olive for extended-spectrum,
cyan for inhibitor-resistant broad-spectrum, purple for inhibitor-resistant
extended-spectrum, salmon for broad-spectrum. Most olive rows are in the top
half and most cyan rows in the bottom half, and 6 of the tree's 44 internal
nodes hold alleles of one phenotype.

## 4. Map Ambler numbering onto the columns

Ambler's scheme starts at 3, skips 239 and 253, and ends at 290 over 286
residues, so Ambler 238 is residue 236 and reading index 238 lands two residues
away with no error. The script maps each position through the TEM-1 row and
checks the result against the residues the reviews name:

```python
found = {p: reference[ambler_column[p]] for p in sorted(TEM1_RESIDUES)}
wrong = {p: r for p, r in found.items() if r != TEM1_RESIDUES[p]}
if wrong:
    raise SystemExit(f'Ambler mapping is off: {wrong}')
```

```
TEM-1 residues at the named Ambler positions: 69M 70S 73K 104E 130S 164R 166E 234K 238G 240E 244R 276N
the mapping is Ambler = residue index + 2 up to 238, + 3 from 240 to 252, + 4 from 254
Ambler [104, 164, 238, 240, 69, 244, 276] are columns 102, 162, 236, 237, 67, 241, 272
```

All twelve residues the reviews name for TEM-1, the catalytic S70 and K73 and
the omega-loop E166 among them, come out where the mapping says.

## 5. Draw the positions as strips

Four positions carry the extended-spectrum substitutions (104, 164, 238, 240),
three the inhibitor-resistance ones (69, 244, 276), and the eighth is step 7's
control. Each is a `strip` row panel, and the eight share one `title`:

```json
"rowPanels": [
  { "kind": "strip", "field": "phenotype", "width": 14, "header": "phenotype" },
  { "kind": "strip", "field": "Ambler 104", "width": 12, "header": "104", "title": "residue" }
]
```

alignment, in the order 104, 164, 238, 240, 69, 244, 276, 265. Olive and purple
rows show a minority residue in the first four strips, cyan rows in the next
three.

```
Ambler 104: E 36, K 10
Ambler 164: R 29, S 11, H 6
Ambler 238: G 40, S 5, R 1
Ambler 240: E 41, K 5
Ambler 69: M 31, L 8, V 4, I 3
Ambler 244: R 42, S 2, C 1, L 1
Ambler 276: N 38, D 8
Ambler 265: T 42, M 4
```

## 6. Compare the two groups of positions

For each allele, whether it differs from TEM-1 at any of the four
extended-spectrum positions, and at any of the three inhibitor-resistance ones:

```
ESBL positions 104/164/238/240: broad-spectrum 0/12, extended-spectrum 12/12, inhibitor-resistant broad-spectrum 0/12, inhibitor-resistant extended-spectrum 10/10
inhibitor positions 69/244/276: broad-spectrum 0/12, extended-spectrum 0/12, inhibitor-resistant broad-spectrum 12/12, inhibitor-resistant extended-spectrum 7/10
```

Every extended-spectrum allele carries a substitution at 104, 164, 238 or 240
and no broad-spectrum allele does, and the three inhibitor-resistance positions
split the other way.

The eight positions also go over the alignment columns as `highlights`, which
take 1-based columns where a band has no `row`, so Ambler 238 is `start: 236`:

```json
"highlights": [{ "start": 236, "end": 236, "label": "Ambler 238" }]
```

Eight bands over the 286 columns, seven red and the control grey, each labeled
with its Ambler position.

`relativeTo` names a row, and the viewer draws a residue matching TEM-1 as a dot
and a differing one as its letter, under a pinned copy of the TEM-1 row:

```json
"relativeTo": "TEM-1"
```

In R the same field is `msaview(relative_to = "TEM-1")` or
`+ stat_msa_diff("TEM-1")`, and in Python the `relative_to` trait.

Ambler 238 and 240 at residue resolution, every row read against TEM-1. The
boxed columns read G and E in the pinned TEM-1 row, S and K in olive and purple
rows, and a dot in every salmon and cyan row.

## 7. Read the control position

For every variable position, how its residues split across the four phenotypes,
scored by Cramer's V over the residue-by-phenotype table:

```
position  residues                  Cramer's V
     104  36E,10K                         0.60
     164  29R,11S,6H                      0.57
     276  38N,8D                          0.48
      69  31M,8L,4V,3I                    0.47
      39  38Q,8K                          0.42
     240  41E,5K                          0.39
     238  40G,5S,1R                       0.37
     ...
     265  42T,4M                          0.22
```

The control is the lowest-scoring position with minor residues in at least three
alleles, so the column has something to read:

```
control position: Ambler 265, T in TEM-1, minor residues in 4 alleles, Cramer's V 0.22
```

Ambler 265 at the resolution of the figure above. The four alleles reading M
cover three of the four phenotypes: TEM-110 broad-spectrum, TEM-9 and TEM-4
extended-spectrum, TEM-68 inhibitor-resistant extended-spectrum.

## 8. Check it against the raw data

The check reads the letters from the unaligned NCBI sequences by Ambler
arithmetic and compares them with the row table:

```python
letters = [unaligned[row][residue_of_ambler[p]] for p in fields]
from_table = [table[row][f'Ambler {p}'] for p in fields]
if letters != from_table:
    raise SystemExit(f'{row}: the FASTA reads {letters}, the row table {from_table}')
```

```
allele     104  164  238  240   69  244  276  265  phenotype

TEM-125      E    S    G    E    L    R    D    T  inhibitor-resistant extended-spectrum
```

TEM-3 reads E104K and G238S, TEM-10 R164S and E240K, TEM-12 R164S, TEM-30 R244S,
TEM-32 M69I, and TEM-125 R164S with M69L and N276D, the substitutions the
primary literature gives for each allele.

One view over the three hosted files, with the `tipLabel` encoding, the nine
strips and the eight bands.

<!-- usage: r -->

[ggmsaview](https://github.com/GMOD/ggmsaview) reads the same three files,
`geom_msa_rowdata()` takes the row table as `jsonlite::fromJSON()` returns it,
and one loop adds a strip per Ambler position:

```r
library(ggmsaview)
data <- "https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/data/tem/"
rows <- jsonlite::fromJSON(paste0(data, "tem-rowdata.json"))
phenotype <- c(
  "broad-spectrum" = "#4e79a7", "extended-spectrum" = "#e15759",
  "inhibitor-resistant broad-spectrum" = "#59a14f",
  "inhibitor-resistant extended-spectrum" = "#b07aa1"
)
residue <- c(C = "#4e79a7", D = "#f28e2b", E = "#e15759", G = "#76b7b2",
  H = "#59a14f", I = "#edc948", K = "#b07aa1", L = "#ff9da7", M = "#9c755f",
  N = "#bab0ac", R = "#86bcb6", S = "#d37295", T = "#a0cbe8", V = "#8cd17d")
ambler <- c(104, 164, 238, 240, 69, 244, 276, 265)
column <- c(102, 162, 236, 237, 67, 241, 272, 261)

w <- msaview(msa = paste0(data, "tem.afa"), tree = paste0(data, "tem.nwk"),
    color_scheme = "clustalx_protein_dynamic") +
  geom_msa_rowdata(rows) +
  scale_row_color("phenotype", channel = "tipLabel") +
  geom_msa_strip("phenotype", range = phenotype)
for (a in ambler) {
  w <- w + geom_msa_strip(paste("Ambler", a), range = residue,
    header = as.character(a), title = "residue")
}
w <- w + geom_msa_highlight(data.frame(start = column, end = column,
  label = paste("Ambler", ambler),
  color = ifelse(ambler == 265, "rgba(120,120,120,0.35)",
    "rgba(225,87,89,0.35)")))
w
ggplot2::ggsave("tem_alleles-final-r.png",
  msaview_plot(w, tracks = "conservation"), width = 12, height = 9)
```

![](../media/tem_alleles-final-r.png)

ggmsaview draws the same strips, bands and conservation track, with one key for
the residue strips and each row name in its phenotype's color.

## Reproduce it end to end

[`build_tem_alleles.sh`](https://github.com/GMOD/JBrowseMSA/blob/main/docs/tutorials/scripts/build_tem_alleles.sh)
runs the commands above in order:

1. It downloads the catalog and the reference proteins, then keeps the twelve
   lowest-numbered alleles of each phenotype.
2. ClustalW aligns the alleles and infers a tree.
3. It maps each Ambler position through the TEM-1 row and writes the row table.
4. It picks the control position and checks the row table against the unaligned
   NCBI sequences.

The script needs the tools under [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/JBrowseMSA/main/docs/tutorials/scripts/build_tem_alleles.sh
bash build_tem_alleles.sh
```

The script prints every number on this page.
