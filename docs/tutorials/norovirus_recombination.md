# Recombination at the norovirus ORF1/ORF2 junction

Norovirus GII has two genotype names, one for its polymerase and one for its
capsid, so a GII.P16-GII.4 Sydney genome has the polymerase of GII.P16 and the
capsid of GII.4 Sydney. The two halves meet at the ORF1/ORF2 junction, so a
recombinant row stops matching one parent there and starts matching the other.
For twelve complete GII genomes, with GII.Pe-GII.4/US/2013 as a control of the
capsid donor's own genotype, we:

- fetch the genomes and align them whole
- draw each genome's ORFs and infer one tree per ORF
- color each row by its closer parent in 200-base windows
- plot identity to each parent across the junction, for the recombinant and the
  control
- check the crossing against the bases and open the result from one link

## Prerequisites

- `curl`
- Docker, which the script uses to run MAFFT 7.525 and FastTree 2.2.0 from their
  biocontainers images.
- Python 3, standard library only

## The data

Twelve norovirus GII genomes as GenBank holds them, sequence and annotation
both. Nothing to download: the commands below fetch them from NCBI.

## 1. Fetch the genomes and their ORFs

Write one genome per line, with the label the viewer draws, the GenBank
accession, and the genotype in the record's isolate name or note. The label
becomes the FASTA defline, the tree tip and the GFF seq_id.

```

```

The three GII.P16-GII.4 rows are the recombinant, GII.P16-GII.2/CN/2016 stands
for the four GII.P16-GII.2 rows as the polymerase donor, and
GII.Pe-GII.4/JP/2012 for the three GII.Pe-GII.4 rows as the capsid donor. Save
the table as `noro-rows.tsv`, then fetch all twelve in two `efetch` requests,
one for the sequences and one for the GenBank flatfiles:

```bash
ids=$(awk -F'\t' '{printf "%s%s", sep, $2; sep=","}' noro-rows.tsv)
curl -sf "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=nuccore&id=$ids&rettype=fasta&retmode=text" -o noro-ncbi.fasta
curl -sf "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=nuccore&id=$ids&rettype=gb&retmode=text" -o noro-ncbi.gb
```

Each record annotates three CDS features in genome order, ORF1's nonstructural
polyprotein, ORF2's VP1 and ORF3's VP2. One regular expression reads their spans
into a GFF:

```python
spans = re.findall(r'^     CDS             (\d+)\.\.(\d+)$', record, re.M)
```

## 2. Align the twelve genomes

MAFFT under `--auto` runs FFT-NS-2 on twelve sequences of 7.5 kb:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work quay.io/biocontainers/mafft:7.525--h031d066_1 \
  mafft --auto --quiet --preservecase noro.fasta > noro.afa
```

```
12 rows, 7778 columns, 2726 gap characters
```

[![](../media/norovirus_recombination-1.png)](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/#data=%7B%22msaview%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22MsaView%22%2C%22height%22%3A500%2C%22treeAreaWidth%22%3A300%2C%22rowHeight%22%3A24%2C%22colWidth%22%3A0.162%2C%22msaFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnorovirus%2Fnoro.afa%22%7D%2C%22treeFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnorovirus%2Fnoro-orf2.nwk%22%7D%7D%7D)

Twelve norovirus genomes as one alignment beside the tree from their ORF2
columns. The conservation track dips where the rows disagree, most of all in
GII.P7-GII.6/UK/2015 and GII.P17-GII.17/KR/2015.

## 3. Draw the ORFs on every row

Load the ORF GFF from step 1 as the annotation file, and the viewer places each
genome's own spans through that row's gaps.

[![](../media/norovirus_recombination-2.png)](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/#data=%7B%22msaview%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22MsaView%22%2C%22height%22%3A500%2C%22treeAreaWidth%22%3A300%2C%22rowHeight%22%3A24%2C%22colWidth%22%3A0.162%2C%22msaFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnorovirus%2Fnoro.afa%22%7D%2C%22treeFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnorovirus%2Fnoro-orf2.nwk%22%7D%2C%22gffFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnorovirus%2Fnoro-orfs.gff%22%7D%2C%22encodings%22%3A%5B%7B%22channel%22%3A%22featureFill%22%2C%22field%22%3A%22Name%22%2C%22scale%22%3A%7B%22map%22%3A%7B%22ORF1%22%3A%22%234e79a7%22%2C%22ORF2%22%3A%22%23e15759%22%2C%22ORF3%22%3A%22%238c8c8c%22%7D%7D%7D%5D%7D%7D)

The alignment with each row's three ORFs as boxes, ORF1 blue, ORF2 red and ORF3
grey. The ORF1/ORF2 boundary falls within a few columns in all twelve rows.

Projecting one row, GII.P16-GII.4/US/2016, gives the column ranges the per-ORF
trees and the junction cut use:

```python
col_of_ref = [i for i, c in enumerate(seqs[REFERENCE]) if c != '-']
orf1 = (col(ref['ORF1'][0]), col(ref['ORF1'][1]))
orf2 = (col(ref['ORF2'][0]), col(ref['ORF2'][1]))
junction = (orf2[0] - FLANK, orf2[0] + FLANK)
```

```
in the alignment, GII.P16-GII.4/US/2016 has ORF1 in columns 5-5157 and ORF2 in columns 5138-6826
the junction cut is columns 4838-5437, 300 columns either side of the first base of ORF2
```

## 4. Infer a tree per ORF

Run FastTree on the ORF1 columns and on the ORF2 columns:

```bash
for orf in orf1 orf2; do
  docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work quay.io/biocontainers/fasttree:2.2.0--h7b50bb2_1 \
    FastTree -nt -gtr -quiet -nosupport "noro-$orf.afa" > "noro-$orf.nwk"
done
```

[![](../media/norovirus_recombination-3.png)](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/#data=%7B%22msaview%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22MsaView%22%2C%22height%22%3A500%2C%22treeAreaWidth%22%3A300%2C%22rowHeight%22%3A24%2C%22colWidth%22%3A0.162%2C%22msaFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnorovirus%2Fnoro.afa%22%7D%2C%22treeFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnorovirus%2Fnoro-orf1.nwk%22%7D%2C%22gffFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnorovirus%2Fnoro-orfs.gff%22%7D%2C%22encodings%22%3A%5B%7B%22channel%22%3A%22featureFill%22%2C%22field%22%3A%22Name%22%2C%22scale%22%3A%7B%22map%22%3A%7B%22ORF1%22%3A%22%234e79a7%22%2C%22ORF2%22%3A%22%23e15759%22%2C%22ORF3%22%3A%22%238c8c8c%22%7D%7D%7D%5D%2C%22showDomainLegend%22%3Afalse%7D%7D)

The alignment under the ORF1 tree, which draws GII.P16-GII.4/US/2016 and
GII.P16-GII.4/US/2017 directly under the four GII.P16-GII.2 rows. The ORF2 tree
in the two figures above draws GII.P16-GII.4/US/2016 directly above the three
GII.Pe-GII.4 rows, 0.0093 away.

## 5. Color each row by its closer parent

Percent identity counts the columns of a span where both rows have a base:

```python
def identity(query, subject, start, end):
    q, s = seqs[query], seqs[subject]
    both = matches = 0
    for i in range(start, end):
        if q[i] != '-' and s[i] != '-':
            both += 1
            matches += q[i] == s[i]
    return 100 * matches / both if both else 0
```

Over a whole ORF, the identity separates the two parents:

```
GII.P16-GII.4/US/2016   ORF1  98.0% to GII.P16-GII.2/CN/2016,  77.5% to GII.Pe-GII.4/JP/2012   ORF2  64.8% and  96.3%
GII.Pe-GII.4/US/2013    ORF1  77.5% to GII.P16-GII.2/CN/2016,  98.8% to GII.Pe-GII.4/JP/2012   ORF2  64.4% and  98.6%
```

In 200-base windows along every row, the same score writes a GFF of each
window's closer parent:

```python
closer, color = (
    ('GII.P16', A_COLOR) if a - b > 1
    else ('GII.4 Sydney', B_COLOR) if b - a > 1
    else ('tie', TIE_COLOR)
)
```

[![](../media/norovirus_recombination-4.png)](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/#data=%7B%22msaview%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22MsaView%22%2C%22height%22%3A500%2C%22treeAreaWidth%22%3A300%2C%22rowHeight%22%3A24%2C%22colWidth%22%3A0.162%2C%22msaFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnorovirus%2Fnoro.afa%22%7D%2C%22treeFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnorovirus%2Fnoro-orf2.nwk%22%7D%2C%22gffFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fnorovirus%2Fnoro-parents.gff%22%7D%2C%22encodings%22%3A%5B%7B%22channel%22%3A%22featureFill%22%2C%22field%22%3A%22Name%22%2C%22scale%22%3A%7B%22map%22%3A%7B%22GII.P16%22%3A%22%234e79a7%22%2C%22GII.4%20Sydney%22%3A%22%23e15759%22%2C%22tie%22%3A%22%23bab0ac%22%7D%7D%7D%5D%2C%22highlights%22%3A%5B%7B%22start%22%3A5124%2C%22end%22%3A5124%2C%22label%22%3A%22breakpoint%22%7D%5D%7D%7D)

Each row's 38 windows, blue (GII.P16) where closer to the polymerase donor, red
(GII.4 Sydney) where closer to the capsid donor and grey for a tie. The three
GII.P16-GII.4 rows have 25 blue windows then 13 red, all switching at the same
base, where the other GII.P16-GII.2 rows are blue throughout and the other
GII.Pe-GII.4 rows red throughout.

## 6. Plot identity across the junction

A finer scan scores a 100-column window stepped one column at a time over the
600-column junction cut. A `bar` track holds one value per column of the file
beneath it, so the cut travels as its own file:

```python
def track_values(row, subject):
    values = []
    for i in range(len(junction[row])):
        center = offset + i
        start = max(0, center - TRACK_WINDOW // 2)
        values.append(round(identity(row, subject, start, start + TRACK_WINDOW)))
    return values
```

```
GII.P16-GII.4/US/2016 to GII.P16-GII.2/CN/2016 (polymerase donor): 600 values, 62-100%
GII.P16-GII.4/US/2016 to GII.Pe-GII.4/JP/2012 (capsid donor): 600 values, 69-99%
in the junction cut the GII.P16-GII.4/US/2016 curves change rank at column 287 of 600, column 5124 of the whole alignment

The alignment, the ORF2 tree and the parent windows, with ORF2 a pale band and
the crossing a line through it.

<!-- usage: r -->

[ggmsaview](https://github.com/GMOD/ggmsaview) reads the same hosted alignment,
ORF2 tree and window GFF, with the window fill as a `scale_row_color()` layer
and the ORF2 band and the crossing as highlights. `w` alone opens the viewer in
RStudio or a notebook, and `msaview_plot()` draws it as a ggplot2 figure:

```r
library(ggmsaview)
data <- "https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/data/norovirus"
w <- msaview(
  msa = file.path(data, "noro.afa"),
  tree = file.path(data, "noro-orf2.nwk"),
  gff = file.path(data, "noro-parents.gff")
) +
  scale_row_color("Name", channel = "featureFill", map = c(
    "GII.P16" = "#4e79a7", "GII.4 Sydney" = "#e15759", tie = "#bab0ac"
  )) +
  geom_msa_highlight(start = 5138, end = 6826, label = "ORF2",
    color = "grey75") +
  geom_msa_highlight(start = 5124, end = 5124, label = "breakpoint")
w
ggplot2::ggsave("norovirus_recombination-8-r.png", msaview_plot(w),
  width = 12, height = 5)
```

The twelve genomes beside the ORF2 tree as a ggplot2 figure, each window filled
by its closer parent. The three GII.P16-GII.4 rows run blue to the breakpoint
line at 5,124 and red after it, inside the grey ORF2 band.

## Reproduce it end to end

[`build_norovirus_recombination.sh`](https://github.com/GMOD/JBrowseMSA/blob/main/docs/tutorials/scripts/build_norovirus_recombination.sh)
runs the steps above in order:

1. It fetches the twelve genomes and their GenBank records from NCBI, writing
   the sequences under their labels and the ORFs as a GFF.
2. MAFFT aligns the genomes, and FastTree builds one tree from the ORF1 columns
   and another from the ORF2 columns, since a recombinant sits in a different
   clade on each side of the junction.
3. It scores every row against the two parents, as a GFF of 200-base windows and
   as bar tracks of identity across the junction.
4. It counts the differences to each parent in the 500 columns either side of
   the crossing, for the recombinant and the control.

It needs the tools under [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/JBrowseMSA/main/docs/tutorials/scripts/build_norovirus_recombination.sh
bash build_norovirus_recombination.sh
```

With no arguments the script writes the row table above and prints every number
on this page, in about a minute, most of it the two Docker pulls. Pass your own
table for another set of genomes:

```bash
bash build_norovirus_recombination.sh my-rows.tsv out/
```

Four labels at the top of the script name the recombinant, its two parents and
the control.
