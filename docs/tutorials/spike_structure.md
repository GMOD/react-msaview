# The SARS-CoV-2 furin insert and PDB 6VXX

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein carries four residues, PRRA, that its closest
relatives do not, and they sit where the protein gets cut in two. The first
cryo-EM structure of the trimer, PDB 6VXX, was solved from a construct with that
site engineered away, and the loop carrying it has no coordinates in the
deposited model. This page aligns eleven coronavirus spikes, puts the four
residues on the alignment, and then maps each residue of the SARS-CoV-2 row to
the structure to find which ones 6VXX resolved. The link carries the result as
data: the alignment, the tree, the domains, and a correspondence between one row
and one chain.

## Prerequisites

- `curl` and `jq`
- python3, for the build script's JSON lookups
- MAFFT, `apt install mafft` on Debian or Ubuntu, `brew install mafft` on macOS
- FastTree, `apt install fasttree`, or `brew install fasttree`
- [react-msaview-cli](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/cli) for the domain GFF,
  `npm install -g react-msaview-cli`, NodeJS v22+

## Where the data comes from

Eleven spike glycoproteins as NCBI holds them, the UniProtKB entry for the
SARS-CoV-2 one, InterPro release 110.0 for the domains, and PDBe for everything
about the structure. The commands below fetch these, so there is nothing to
download by hand.

- all eleven protein sequences in one efetch request, shown here with one
  accession, for example:
  https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=protein&id=YP_009724390.1&rettype=fasta&retmode=text
- the UniProtKB entry, for its sequence and its feature table:
  https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P0DTC2.json
- precomputed Pfam matches for one accession:
  https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/api/entry/pfam/protein/uniprot/P0DTC2/
- the SIFTS residue correspondence between UniProt and the PDB entry:
  https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/api/mappings/uniprot/6vxx
- which residues of chain A have coordinates:
  https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/api/pdb/entry/polymer_coverage/6vxx/chain/A
- the sequence the entry deposited, tags included:
  https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/api/pdb/entry/molecules/6vxx
- the structure itself, for a structure viewer:
  https://files.rcsb.org/download/6VXX.cif

Every PDBe and UniProt endpoint here serves a single record per request and
sends `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`.

- the alignment: https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/data/spike/spike.afa
- its tree: https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/data/spike/spike.nwk
- its domains: https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/data/spike/spike-domains.gff
- the three layers, as the build script wrote them:
  https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/data/spike/spike-layers.json

</details>

## 1. Name the rows

The row table has three columns: the NCBI protein the alignment uses, the label
the viewer draws, and the UniProtKB entry for the same protein where one exists.

```
YP_009724390.1	SARS-CoV-2	P0DTC2
QHR63300.2	RaTG13	A0ABF7PLN6
UAY13217.1	BANAL-20-52	-
QIA48632.1	Pangolin-GX	-
NP_828851.1	SARS-CoV	P59594
YP_009047204.1	MERS-CoV	K9N5Q8
YP_001039953.1	HKU4	A3EX94
YP_173238.1	HKU1	Q0ZME7
YP_009555241.1	OC43	P36334
NP_073551.1	229E	P15423
YP_003767.1	NL63	Q6Q1S2
```

Save that as `rows.tsv`. The separators are tabs. The label travels through the
whole page: it becomes the FASTA defline, the tree tip, the GFF `seq_id`, and
the `row` field of every layer, and the viewer matches them to each other by it.

InterPro keys its precomputed matches by the third column. A `-` means UniProtKB
has no entry for that isolate's spike: BANAL-20-52 is the Laos bat virus from
Temmam et al., Pangolin-GX is the GX-P5L isolate, and both exist only as GenBank
records.

## 2. Fetch the sequences

Fetch all eleven in one request, then relabel each record by virus:

```bash
# a comma-separated id list fetches all eleven in one efetch call
ids=$(cut -f1 rows.tsv | paste -sd,)
curl -sf "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi\
?db=protein&id=$ids&rettype=fasta&retmode=text" -o spike-ncbi.fasta
```

Read the lengths before aligning anything:

```
SARS-CoV-2   YP_009724390.1   1273 aa
RaTG13       QHR63300.2       1269 aa
BANAL-20-52  UAY13217.1       1269 aa
Pangolin-GX  QIA48632.1       1267 aa
SARS-CoV     NP_828851.1      1255 aa
MERS-CoV     YP_009047204.1   1353 aa
HKU4         YP_001039953.1   1352 aa
HKU1         YP_173238.1      1356 aa
OC43         YP_009555241.1   1353 aa
229E         NP_073551.1      1173 aa
NL63         YP_003767.1      1356 aa
```

All eleven are full-length spikes of 1173 to 1356 residues. The four
sarbecoviruses at the top are within six residues of each other, and the rest
differ from them by up to 180 residues. A truncated fragment or a stray
polyprotein would show up in this list as an outlying length.

## 3. Align them

```bash
mafft --auto spike.fasta > spike.afa
```

`--auto` picks its strategy from the size of the input, and on eleven sequences
MAFFT reports choosing L-INS-i, the accurate and slow one. The run takes five
seconds and writes 1660 columns, 304 more than the longest input, to hold the
insertions.

## 4. Infer a tree

```bash
# -lg is the amino-acid substitution model; the Newick goes to stdout and the
# progress to stderr
FastTree -lg spike.afa > spike.nwk
```

```
(SARS-CoV-2:0.007478676,BANAL-20-52:0.004978619,(RaTG13:0.009142493,
(Pangolin-GX:0.038420176,(SARS-CoV:0.140352604,((229E:0.227306296,
NL63:0.306929144)1.000:1.267772518,((MERS-CoV:0.289975358,HKU4:0.170994428)...
```

The four sarbecoviruses sit on branches of 0.005 to 0.04 while the two
alphacoronaviruses are at 0.23 and 0.31, so most of the tree's width separates
229E and NL63 from the other rows.

[![](../media/spike-structure-alignment.png)](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/#data=%7B%22msaview%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22MsaView%22%2C%22height%22%3A400%2C%22treeAreaWidth%22%3A170%2C%22colWidth%22%3A0.8%2C%22rowHeight%22%3A22%2C%22colorSchemeName%22%3A%22clustalx_protein_dynamic%22%2C%22msaFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fspike%2Fspike.afa%22%7D%2C%22treeFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fspike%2Fspike.nwk%22%7D%7D%7D)

Eleven spikes in 1660 columns, with rows ordered by the tree. The left half, S1,
breaks into blocks separated by long gaps; the right half, S2, runs nearly
unbroken across all eleven rows.

## 5. Ask InterPro for the domains

InterPro precomputes the matches for every UniProtKB sequence, so no scan is
needed. The matches use the UniProtKB entry's numbering, and these rows are NCBI
records, so the entry has to be the same protein as the row before its
coordinates apply to it:

```bash
# same length means substitutions only, so residue n is residue n in both;
# a length difference is an indel, and every boundary after it has moved
curl -sf "https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P0DTC2.fasta" |
  tail -n +2 | tr -d '\n' | wc -c
```

```
1273
```

The SARS-CoV-2 row is also 1273 residues. The same check for every row with an
accession:

```
SARS-CoV-2   P0DTC2 same length, 0 substitution(s)
RaTG13       A0ABF7PLN6 same length, 0 substitution(s)
BANAL-20-52  no UniProtKB entry, so no precomputed matches
Pangolin-GX  no UniProtKB entry, so no precomputed matches
SARS-CoV     P59594 same length, 1 substitution(s)
MERS-CoV     K9N5Q8 same length, 2 substitution(s)
HKU4         A3EX94 same length, 0 substitution(s)
HKU1         Q0ZME7 is 1351 aa against the row's 1356, so its numbering is not the row's: dropped
OC43         P36334 same length, 2 substitution(s)
229E         P15423 same length, 0 substitution(s)
NL63         Q6Q1S2 same length, 0 substitution(s)
```

Eight rows pass. The HKU1 RefSeq protein and the HKU1 UniProt entry are
different isolates five residues apart in length, and the domains of one placed
on the other would be off by five past the indel.

The eight go into `spike-uniprot.tsv`, one accession and label per line, which
the CLI reads:

```bash
react-msaview-cli interpro spike-uniprot.tsv -o spike-domains.gff
```

```
InterPro release 110.0; reading precomputed pfam matches...
  [1/8] P0DTC2: 4 pfam entries
  ...
8 fetched, 0 from /home/you/.cache/react-msaview-cli/interpro
```

[![](../media/spike-structure-domains.png)](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/#data=%7B%22msaview%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22MsaView%22%2C%22height%22%3A400%2C%22treeAreaWidth%22%3A170%2C%22colWidth%22%3A0.8%2C%22rowHeight%22%3A22%2C%22colorSchemeName%22%3A%22clustalx_protein_dynamic%22%2C%22msaFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fspike%2Fspike.afa%22%7D%2C%22treeFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fspike%2Fspike.nwk%22%7D%2C%22gffFilehandle%22%3A%7B%22uri%22%3A%22data%2Fspike%2Fspike-domains.gff%22%7D%7D%7D)

The betacoronavirus rows share a four-part architecture: S1 N-terminal domain,
S1 receptor-binding, S1 C-terminal, then S2. 229E and NL63 carry the
alphacoronavirus S1 signature instead, one box where the others have three. The
three rows the arrows point at are empty: two of those isolates are in no
UniProtKB entry, and the third is HKU1, whose entry the length check dropped.

## 6. The PRRA insert

No feature table annotates the insert, since it is defined by what the other
sequences lack. Find it in the sequence:

```bash
awk '/^>SARS-CoV-2/{getline; print index($0, "PRRA")}' spike.fasta
```

```
681
```

The insert is residues 681 to 684, in alignment columns 992 to 995. A
`highlights` entry in residue coordinates puts a labeled band on them, and the
viewer converts the coordinates to columns:

```json
"highlights": [
  { "row": "SARS-CoV-2", "start": 681, "end": 684, "label": "PRRA insert" },
  { "row": "SARS-CoV-2", "start": 685, "end": 686, "label": "Furin cleavage" }
]
```

The S1/S2 junction at base resolution, every row read against SARS-CoV-2: a dot
is the same residue, a letter a different one. The boxed columns are the insert,
and the band beside it is the furin cleavage site UniProt annotates at 685-686.

Columns 992, 993 and 994 are gap in all ten other rows. Column 995 is gap in six
of them and carries S in HKU1, K in OC43, and I in both 229E and NL63, the four
rows furthest from SARS-CoV-2 in the tree. The column immediately after the
insert, 996, is R685 here and an R in every other betacoronavirus row, so the
arginine is shared and the four residues before it are not.

## 7. Residues resolved in 6VXX

A PDB entry numbers its residues its own way, so SIFTS supplies the
correspondence between residues of the row and residues of the structure:

```bash
curl -s https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/api/mappings/uniprot/6vxx |
  jq -c '.["6vxx"].UniProt.P0DTC2.mappings[] | select(.chain_id == "A") |
         {unp_start, unp_end, start: .start.residue_number,
          end: .end.residue_number, identity}'
```

```
{"unp_start":14,"unp_end":1211,"start":33,"end":1230,"identity":0.97}
```

SIFTS returns one block, offset by 19 for its whole length, with an identity of
0.97. The construct accounts for both, and the entry describes it:

```bash
curl -s https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/api/pdb/entry/molecules/6vxx |
  jq -r '.["6vxx"][0] | .length, .sequence[:32], .sequence[-51:]'
```

```
1281
MGILPSPGMPALLSLVSLLSVLLMGCVAETGT
GSGRENLYFQGGGGSGYIPEAPRDGQAYVRKDGEWVLLSTFLGHHHHHHHH
```

The deposited entity is 1281 residues. It opens with 32 that are not spike, a
signal peptide the expression vector supplied, and ends with 51 more that are
not spike either: a TEV site, a foldon that trimerizes it, and a His tag. The 32
leading residues set the offset of 19.

Comparing the mapped stretch of the entity against the row position by position
turns up five differences, which the build script prints:

```
6VXX 701 is S where row residue 682 is R
6VXX 702 is G where row residue 683 is R
6VXX 704 is G where row residue 685 is R
6VXX 1005 is P where row residue 986 is K
6VXX 1006 is P where row residue 987 is V
```

The construct replaces the three arginines of the furin site with S, G and G,
which disables the site so the trimer survives purification. K986P and V987P are
the two prolines that hold it in the prefusion conformation.

Author numbering is a third system again:

```bash
curl -s https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/api/pdb/entry/polymer_coverage/6vxx/chain/A |
  jq -c '.["6vxx"].molecules[0].chains[0].observed[0].start'
```

```
{"residue_number":46,"author_residue_number":27,"author_insertion_code":null,"struct_asym_id":"A"}
```

Twelve stretches of the chain have coordinates, and the first begins here. The
residue the authors call 27 is the 46th position of the entry's own SEQRES, and
the layer uses `label_seq_id` throughout, because author numbering carries
insertion codes and integer arithmetic on it is wrong.

The `residueMappings` layer holds both: the SIFTS block as a segment, the gaps
between the observed stretches as `unobserved`, and the ungapped length of the
row it was computed against, so the viewer ignores the mapping if it is loaded
beside a different alignment.

```json
"residueMappings": [
  {
    "row": "SARS-CoV-2",
    "accession": "P0DTC2",
    "structure": {
      "id": "6VXX",
      "kind": "experimental",
      "asymId": "A",
      "url": "https://files.rcsb.org/download/6VXX.cif"
    },
    "segments": [
      { "rowStart": 14, "rowEnd": 1211, "structStart": 33, "structEnd": 1230 }
    ],
    "unobserved": [
      [33, 45], [89, 98], [163, 183], [192, 204], [265, 281], [464, 465],
      [474, 480], [488, 507], [521, 521], [640, 659], [696, 707], [847, 872],
      [1167, 1230]
    ],
    "rowLength": 1273,
    "generated": { "by": "sifts", "date": "2026-09-13" }
  }
]
```

Of the 1273 residues in the row, 972 are mapped and observed, 226 are mapped and
not resolved, and 75 are outside the construct. The layer itself draws nothing,
so the build script turns the same three states into a `columnTracks` text
track, one character per residue of the row, which the viewer projects through
that row's gaps and colors: green for observed, orange for declared and not
resolved, gray for outside the construct.

```json
{
  "id": "6vxx-coverage",
  "name": "6VXX chain A",
  "kind": "text",
  "row": "SARS-CoV-2",
  "data": "NNNNNNNNNNNNNUUUUUUUUUUUUUOOOOOOOOOO...",
  "colors": { "O": "#2e7d32", "U": "#e65100", "N": "#cfd8dc" }

The correspondence over the whole alignment. The ribbon above the rows is chain
A of 6VXX read along the SARS-CoV-2 row, gray at both ends where the construct
is not spike, and orange wherever the model declares residues it did not
resolve. The boxed columns are the furin loop.

6VXX declares residues 696 to 707, row residues 677 to 688, and resolves none of
them. The insert sits in the middle of that stretch: 0 of its 4 residues are
observed, and 0 of the 2 in the cleavage site beside it.

## 8. A fully resolved region

The control is the same row, chain and layer at the first heptad repeat:

HR1 at base resolution, row residues 920-970, structure residues 939-989. The
ribbon reads O for all 51, and the columns underneath are the most conserved
block in the figure. The blank stretch in the ribbon is where SARS-CoV-2 has no
residue at all: 229E and NL63 carry an insertion there.

Coverage across the regions UniProt annotates on this row:

| Region                   | Observed | Declared, not resolved |
| ------------------------ | -------: | ---------------------: |
| RBD (319-541)            |      193 |                     30 |
| RBM (437-508)            |       42 |                     30 |
| PRRA insert (681-684)    |        0 |                      4 |
| Furin cleavage (685-686) |        0 |                      2 |
| Fusion peptide (816-837) |       12 |                     10 |
| HR1 (920-970)            |       51 |                      0 |
| HR2 (1163-1202)          |        0 |                     40 |

The receptor-binding motif is the tip that swings up to meet ACE2, and 30 of its
72 residues are unresolved in this closed trimer. HR2 sits past residue 1147,
where the model stops.

## 9. Check it against the raw data

Three commands recover the key numbers from the source data:

```bash
# the insert, in the row the viewer draws
awk '/^>SARS-CoV-2/{getline; print index($0, "PRRA")}' spike.fasta

# the block the mapping's one segment came from
curl -s https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/api/mappings/uniprot/6vxx |
  jq -c '.["6vxx"].UniProt.P0DTC2.mappings[] | select(.chain_id == "A") |
         [.unp_start, .unp_end, .start.residue_number, .end.residue_number]'

# the stretch the furin loop falls in, in label_seq_id
curl -s https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/api/pdb/entry/polymer_coverage/6vxx/chain/A |
  jq -c '.["6vxx"].molecules[0].chains[0].observed[9,10] |
         [.start.residue_number, .end.residue_number]'
```

```
681
[14,1211,33,1230]
[660,695]
[708,846]
```

The highlight starts at 681. `[14,1211,33,1230]` is the segment in the layer,
offset 19. The observed stretches on either side end at 695 and resume at 708,
so 696 to 707 have no coordinates. Those are row residues 677 to 688, the loop
that holds the insert.

## 10. Open the whole thing

The view combines three hosted files and three layers. The files go behind URLs,
because an alignment does not fit in a link, and the layers go in the link,
because they take a few kilobytes:

```json
{
  "msaview": {
    "type": "MsaView",
    "colWidth": 0.8,
    "rowHeight": 22,
    "colorSchemeName": "clustalx_protein_dynamic",
    "msaFilehandle": { "uri": "https://example.org/spike.afa" },
    "treeFilehandle": { "uri": "https://example.org/spike.nwk" },
    "gffFilehandle": { "uri": "https://example.org/spike-domains.gff" }
  }
}
```

Add the `columnTracks`, `highlights` and `residueMappings` entries from the
sections above beside those three, URL-encode the whole object, and hang it off
the app as `#data=`.

The final view shows the tree, the domain architecture, the seven labeled
regions of the SARS-CoV-2 row, and the 6VXX ribbon along the top.

A host that loads this view can look up a row residue in the structure, and gets
`undefined` where the mapping has no answer:

```js
model.structureResidue('SARS-CoV-2', 970) // 6VXX 989, observed
model.structureResidue('SARS-CoV-2', 681) // 6VXX 700, not observed
model.structureResidue('SARS-CoV-2', 1250) // undefined: past the construct
model.structureResidue('RaTG13', 681) // undefined: no mapping for that row
model.rowResidue('6VXX', 700) // SARS-CoV-2, residue 681
```

## Reproduce it end to end

[`build_spike_structure.sh`](https://github.com/GMOD/JBrowseMSA/blob/main/docs/tutorials/scripts/build_spike_structure.sh)
runs the commands above in order:

1. It fetches the eleven protein sequences in one efetch request and relabels
   each record by its virus, the label that travels into the tree tips, the GFF
   seq_id and the `row` field of every layer.
2. MAFFT aligns the sequences and FastTree infers a tree from the alignment.
3. `react-msaview-cli interpro` writes the domain GFF from InterPro's
   precomputed matches, keyed by UniProtKB accession, and drops the domains of
   any row whose NCBI record and UniProt entry differ in length.
4. It reads UniProt's feature table, the SIFTS residue correspondence and PDBe's
   polymer coverage of 6VXX chain A, writes them as the snapshot layers, and
   checks the insert and the unresolved loop against the raw sequence.

It needs the tools under [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GMOD/JBrowseMSA/main/docs/tutorials/scripts/build_spike_structure.sh
bash build_spike_structure.sh
```

With no arguments the script writes the row table above and builds all four
files beside it. Pass your own table to do the same for another family and
another structure:

```bash
bash build_spike_structure.sh my-rows.tsv out/
```
