# Data layers

Every field below is a property of the `MsaView` model, so a host can write it
into the standalone app's `#data=` URL, pass it to `MSAModelF().create`, set it
through `MSAViewer` props, or give it to the R widget. The viewer draws each
layer as given, keeps it in a shared URL, and includes it in the SVG export.
Wherever a layer names a row, positions are that row's residues, 1-based and
inclusive, as in GFF, and the viewer projects them through the alignment's gaps.
Without a row, positions are alignment columns.

**Every figure below links to the app in the state it shows.** Each one is an
`MsaView` snapshot. To open one, put its JSON in `#data=`, either bare or
wrapped as `{"msaview": {...}}`, the form the app writes back to the address
bar. The JSON can go in as typed:

```
https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/#data={"type":"MsaView","msaFilehandle":{"uri":"data/p53/p53-vertebrates.afa"},"relativeTo":"Human"}
```

A script can URL-encode it instead. The encoded link survives a chat message or
a markdown file that would cut a link short at a quote or a space:

```js
const snapshot = {
  type: 'MsaView',
  data: { msa: '>human\nMKAANSE\n>mouse\nMKA-NSE' },
}
const url = `https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/#data=${encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(snapshot))}`
```

The [user guide](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/guide#link-to-a-view) covers what
else a link needs: file URIs, CORS, and the size limit on inline data.

## Shorthand

A link or a script can write a view in short forms, which `expandSpec` (exported
from `react-msaview`) turns into the snapshot. The app's `#data=` and
jbrowse-plugin-msaview's session spec both apply it, and a full snapshot passes
through unchanged.

```json
{

  "msa": "https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/demo/data/p53/p53-vertebrates.afa",

| a column track's `start`   | the position its `values` or `data` begins at, so leading zeros stay out of the link    |

Without `query`, the same highlight forms are alignment columns and a single one
gets no label. `"row": null` on an object entry takes it off the query row onto
alignment columns. A highlight's `label` may name `{residue}` and `{position}`,
which the viewer fills from the row's letter at `start`: `175` expands to the
label `{residue}{position}`. A malformed string, such as `"R175"` or
`"170..290"`, opens the view on an error naming it.

## columnTracks

A track above the alignment, supplied as data. `kind` picks what it draws: `bar`
reads `values`, `text` reads `data`, `arc` reads `arcs`. `row` makes any of them
index that row's residues instead of alignment columns, so the first one is
residue 1 and the viewer fills in the row's gaps. A data track appears in the
Tracks menu, toggles like any other, and exports to SVG.

| `row`      | both | Row name whose residues the values or characters index                                                     |
| `height`   | both | Pixel height (default 40 for a bar, 50 for an arc, the row height for text)                                |

A `row` on an arc track carries both ends of every arc, so a contact map
computed in a protein's own numbering lands on the alignment without conversion.
The viewer draws arcs on one baseline in the order given, and a `color` on an
individual arc overrides the track's, so one track can separate nested helices
from a pseudoknot.

An RNA Stockholm file needs no arc track, because `#=GC SS_cons` already pairs
the columns. The viewer draws a **Base pairs** track from it and gives
pseudoknot pairs their own color. WUSS writes a pseudoknot pair as `A`/`a`
because it crosses a helix, and brackets can only nest.

A track over 50 kB serialized stays in the live model but leaves the snapshot,
under the same [size rule](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/guide#link-to-a-view)
that applies to inline alignments. The demo app raises the limit to 1 MB, as
much as its links hold, and `MSAModelF({ maxInlineSnapshotBytes })` sets it for
another host. To go past it, host the values and set them at runtime with
`model.setColumnTracks(...)`.

## highlights

A labeled band over a column range or a residue range, or a tint over a set of
rows. `label` and `color` are optional; `color` is any CSS color and paints the
band, its border, or the row tint.

[![](media/layers-highlights.png)][live-layers-highlights]

p53 across fifteen vertebrates, read as a diff against Human. The two wide bands
are UniProt domains given as residue ranges of the Human row, the six narrow
ones are the IARC hotspot residues, and the blue wash is a `rows` entry over the
five non-mammals, labeled in the tree gutter.

```json
"highlights": [
  { "row": "human", "start": 248, "end": 248, "label": "R248Q · 651/658 R" },
  { "start": 40, "end": 60, "label": "NES", "color": "rgba(0,120,255,0.25)" },
  { "rows": ["beluga", "dolphin"], "label": "frameshift carriers" }
]
```

`row` plus `start`/`end` is a residue range of that row, `start`/`end` alone is
a column range, and `rows` marks whole rows across the tree labels and the
alignment. A range that lands entirely on hidden gappy columns draws nothing;
one that straddles them shrinks to the visible part. The viewer ignores row
names that match no row.

React: the `highlights` prop on `MSAViewer`, or `model.setHighlights(list)`. R:
`msaview(highlights = list(list(row = "human", start = 248, end = 248)))`.

For a transient highlight, such as one following a hover in a structure viewer
or a genome browser, call `model.applyHighlight(owner, list)` and
`model.clearHighlight(owner)`. They take the same shape, draw over the persisted
highlights, and stay out of the snapshot. `clearHighlight(owner)` removes only
that owner's highlights, so two sources can highlight at once.

`region` takes the same coordinates and names where the view opens:
`{"row": "Human", "start": 170, "end": 290}` zooms onto those residues and
scrolls the Human row to the middle, once the alignment and any tree file have
loaded. The viewer then clears it, so a reloaded session keeps the reader's own
scroll. `model.revealRegion(region)` does the same at runtime, and
`model.zoomToRegion(region)` zooms without touching the vertical scroll.

## selection

A block of the alignment, selected: columns `start` to `end` of the file,
1-based and inclusive, across the rows `rows` names, or across every row where
`rows` is absent. The viewer draws it as a bordered blue band, and a shift-drag
in the viewer replaces it, so a link can open on a block and a script can read
back the block a person chose.

```json
{
  "type": "MsaView",
  "data": { "msa": ">human\nMKAANSE\n>mouse\nMKA-NSE\n>chicken\nMKSANSE" },
  "selection": { "start": 2, "end": 5, "rows": ["human", "mouse"] }
}
```

[Open this snapshot in the app][live-layers-selection].

`start` and `end` count every column of the file, hidden gappy ones included,
the way a column highlight does, so hiding gaps leaves the band on the same
residues. A selection that lies entirely on hidden columns draws nothing. The
header's selection menu copies the block as FASTA across those columns, gaps
kept, and zooms to it.

React: the `selection` prop on `MSAViewer`, with `onSelectionChange` reporting
each change the reader makes, or `model.setSelection(block)`. R:
`msaview(selection = list(start = 2, end = 5, rows = c("human", "mouse")))` or
`geom_msa_selection(2, 5, rows = c("human", "mouse"))`, with
`input$<id>_selection` in Shiny. Python: the `selection` trait, which the widget
also writes back.

## relativeTo

The name of a row to read every other row against. With one set, the viewer:

- draws a residue matching the reference row's residue in its column as a dot on
  a grey cell, so only the differences keep their color
- repeats the reference row as a track pinned above the alignment, so it stays
  in view while the rows under it scroll; the row keeps its place in the tree
- numbers the position ruler and the track tooltips in the reference row's own
  residues, and reads a number typed into the **Go to row or column** box as one
  of them

```json
{
  "type": "MsaView",
  "data": { "msa": ">human\nMKAANSE\n>mouse\nMKA-NSE\n>chicken\nMKSANSE" },
  "relativeTo": "human"
}
```

[Open this snapshot in the app][live-layers-relative-to].

The pinned track's id is `reference-row`, so
`"turnedOffTracks": { "reference-row": true }` keeps the dots and drops the
copy. In the shorthand, `query` sets `relativeTo` and also names the row whose
residues the highlights count.

React: the `relativeTo` prop on `MSAViewer`, or `model.drawRelativeTo(name)`. R:
`msaview(relative_to = "human")` or `+ stat_msa_diff("human")`. Python: the
`relative_to` trait.

## clades

A clade of the tree with a mark over it. `mark` takes one of five values:

- `highlight` fills the rows behind the clade with a translucent rectangle,
  running from the clade's common ancestor to the right edge of the tree area
  and on across the alignment, which is ggtree's `geom_hilight`.
- `bracket` draws a vertical bar beside the clade's rows carrying the record's
  `label`, which is ggtree's `geom_cladelab` and, over a `range`, `geom_strip`.
- `collapse` collapses the clade at load, the way the branch menu's "Collapse
  clade" does.
- `focus` opens the viewer on the clade alone, the way "Show only this clade"
  does.
- `rotate` swaps the order of the clade's children at load, the way "Rotate
  clade" does, which is ggtree's `rotate`. The rows follow the tips.

[![](media/layers-clades.png)][live-layers-clades]

46 TEM beta-lactamase alleles. The seven-tip clade at the top carries a
`highlight` and a `bracket` over the same `mrca`; the clade under it carries a
`collapse` and draws as a triangle labeled with its six tips. Tip labels take
their color from an `encodings` entry over the phenotype field.

```json
"clades": [
  {
    "mrca": ["Gs/TW/TNC1/2015", "Ck/TW/a174/2015"],
    "tips": 47,
    "mark": "highlight",
    "color": "#fff3c4",
    "label": "2.3.4.4 H5Nx"
  },
  {
    "mrca": ["Gs/TW/TNC1/2015", "Ck/TW/a174/2015"],
    "tips": 47,
    "mark": "bracket",
    "color": "#b45309",
    "label": "2.3.4.4 H5Nx"
  },
  { "mrca": ["Dk/VN/1/2012", "Ck/VN/14/2012"], "tips": 6, "mark": "collapse" }
]
```

`mrca` names tips whose most recent common ancestor is the clade, and the mark
covers every tip under that ancestor. Two names are enough for a clade of any
size, and a name the tree does not have, or has twice, drops the record.

`tips` is the leaf count the producer measured. The viewer counts the leaves
under the ancestor it resolved, and a count that differs drops the clade, so a
re-rooted or re-estimated tree loses the mark instead of drawing it over a
different clade.

`range` takes the two ends of a run of tips in display order, in either order,
and covers every tip between them, monophyletic or not. Its `tips` is checked
against the length of the run:

```json
{ "range": ["Dk/VN/1/2012", "Ck/VN/14/2012"], "tips": 6, "mark": "highlight" }
```

`color` is any CSS color, defaulting to a light yellow. A highlight's color
carrying no alpha of its own draws at 60% opacity, so the branches and the
residues under it stay readable. A bracket draws its bar and its label in that
color at full strength, and takes the theme's text color without one.

The bracket gutter is at the right of the tree area, between the tip labels and
the first row panel or the alignment, as wide as the bar plus the widest label
at the tree font, to a limit of 140px, past which a label is cut with an
ellipsis. A label reads across the rows where they are taller than the font, and
runs up the bar where they are not. A `highlight` record carrying a `label`
draws it the same way, with no bar.

`collapse`, `focus` and `rotate` seed the viewer's own `collapsed`, `showOnly`
and `rotated` lists when the tree resolves, so `hideGaps` counts the rows that
remain exactly as when the user collapses a clade by hand. The three marks name
a node, so they need `mrca`: a `range` record carrying one of them drops.
Expanding a seeded clade or clearing the focus holds until the tree is rerooted,
and the record applies again the next time the link is opened.

Every mark resolves against the tree as loaded, so collapsing a clade's ancestor
or focusing on part of the tree keeps the mark on the rows that remain on
screen.

React: the `clades` prop on `MSAViewer`, or `model.setClades(list)`. R:
`geom_msa_clade(c("Gs/TW/TNC1/2015", "Ck/TW/a174/2015"), tips = 47)`.

## treeOrder and treeRoot

`treeOrder` sets the order each node's children draw in, top to bottom, and the
rows of the alignment follow the tips:

- `branchLength`, the default, puts the child with the shorter branch first.
- `input` keeps the order the tree file gives.
- `ladderize` puts the child with fewer tips first, so the deep clades step down
  toward the bottom, which is ape's `ladderize` as `plot.phylo` draws it.
- `ladderizeReverse` puts the child with more tips first, which is ggtree's
  default.

A rotation from the branch menu or a `rotate` clade reverses one node's children
after the order applies. "Undo rotations" in the tree settings clears them.

`treeRoot` reroots the tree before the viewer draws it. `"midpoint"` puts the
root halfway along the longest path between two tips, the usual root for the
unrooted trees FastTree, IQ-TREE and neighbor joining write. An outgroup puts it
halfway along the branch above the tips' most recent common ancestor:

```json
"treeRoot": { "outgroup": ["Dk/VN/1/2012", "Ck/VN/14/2012"] }
```

Where that ancestor is the root of the file's tree, the outgroup straddles the
root, and the viewer roots above the common ancestor of the other tips, which is
the same branch of the unrooted tree. A tree whose outgroup resolves to neither
side, or names a tip it does not have, keeps its own root.

A support value labels the branch above its node. When the viewer reroots, the
nodes between the new root and the old one turn over, and each support value
moves with its branch to the node now at the lower end of it. A root with two
children has one branch left once the new root takes one of them, so the viewer
drops it and joins its two branches into one.

"Reroot here" in the branch menu writes the outgroup as the first and last tip
of the node's side of the split in the file's tree, so a second reroot resolves
against the file and the link stays short. Rerooting renumbers the nodes, so it
clears `collapsed`, `rotated` and `showOnly`, and the `collapse`, `focus` and
`rotate` clades seed again on the new tree.

React: the `treeOrder` and `treeRoot` props on `MSAViewer`, or
`model.setTreeOrder(order)` and `model.setTreeRoot(root)`. R:
`coord_tree(order = "ladderize", root = "midpoint")`, or `root` as a vector of
outgroup tip names. Python: `tree_order` and `tree_root`, the latter
`"midpoint"`, one tip name or a list of them.

## rowData

A table of fields per row, keyed by row name: a lineage, a host, a collection
date, a kinase group. The `encodings` below color the viewer's marks by one of
these fields, the tree's node-info dialog lists a row's fields, and a `genome`
field replaces the row name in the tree labels.

The model keeps the table as the JSON string `data.treeMetadata`, the field name
that travels in existing links, so a snapshot carries it there:

```json
{
  "type": "MsaView",
  "data": {
    "msa": ">duck\nMKAANSE\n>chicken\nMKA-NSE",
    "treeMetadata": "{\"duck\":{\"clade\":\"2.3.4.4b\"},\"chicken\":{\"clade\":\"2.3.2.1c\"}}"
  }
}
```

[Open this snapshot in the app][live-layers-rowdata].

Everywhere else the table is an object: the `rowData` prop on `MSAViewer`,
`model.setRowData(table)`, `geom_msa_rowdata(df)` in R, and the `row_data` trait
in Python. R takes a data frame whose `label` or `row` column names each row and
whose other columns are the fields, the shape a ggtree
`tibble(label = , trait = )` has.

A field's value can be a string, a number or a boolean. The viewer reads a
number or a boolean as its string, `2015` as `"2015"`, the way it reads a GFF
attribute, and leaves out a null or a nested object.

A real metadata table needs the filehandle. Five thousand rows with eight fields
run to roughly 700 kB, far past the 50 kB inline limit a jbrowse session keeps,
so the snapshot drops the table and `unshareableData` reports the drop. Host the
JSON and set `treeMetadataFilehandle` to its URL, and the viewer fetches the
table at startup:

```json
{
  "type": "MsaView",
  "msaFilehandle": { "uri": "https://example.org/h5.fa" },
  "treeMetadataFilehandle": { "uri": "https://example.org/h5-lineages.json" }
}
```

## features

Features on the rows as JSON, the form a GFF line takes once parsed: `row`,
`start` and `end` in residues of that row, 1-based and inclusive, with an
optional `name`, `description`, `type`, `strand` and `color`. The viewer draws
them in the annotation overlay beside the GFF's, under the same legend, filter
dialog and feature channels.

```json
{
  "type": "MsaView",
  "data": { "msa": ">human\nMKAANSEMKAANSE\n>mouse\nMKA-NSEMKA-NSE" },
  "features": [
    { "row": "human", "start": 2, "end": 7, "name": "SH3", "source": "pfam" },
    { "row": "mouse", "start": 3, "end": 9, "name": "SH2", "source": "smart" }
  ],
  "encodings": [{ "channel": "featureFill", "field": "source" }]
}
```

[Open this snapshot in the app][live-layers-features].

`name` is the key the legend, the accession palette and the filter dialog group
features by, and an unnamed feature takes `row:start-end`. `color` overrides the
palette and any scale, as a GFF `color=` attribute does. A `strand` of `+` or
`-` draws the span as an arrow whatever its `type`, and a `type` of `exon`,
`CDS` or a UTR draws it as a numbered segment. Every other field, such as
`source` above, is a column the `featureFill` and `featureLabel` channels read
the way they read a GFF attribute.

A host that computes its spans passes them here, and a file of them loads
through `data.gff` or `gffFilehandle`. React: the `features` prop on
`MSAViewer`, or `model.setFeatures(features)`. R: a data frame given to
`msaview(gff = )` or `geom_msa_domains()`, with a `row` (or `seqname`) column
and every other column a field. Python: the `features` trait, which takes a list
of dicts or a DataFrame.

## encodings

What the viewer's own marks read from a table. Each entry names a `channel`, the
`field` feeding it, and the color object's members, the scale that turns a field
value into a color: its `domain` of values, the `range` of colors they map onto
and the `title` of its legend.

[![](media/layers-encodings.png)][live-layers-encodings]

The same 46 alleles with three channels over the row table: `tipLabel` and
`branch` over the phenotype field, and `rowTint` over the subclass field through
a `domain` that names one of its two values, so the alleles it leaves out take
no tint. Each field lists its own legend.

| Field     | Meaning                                                                    |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `scale`   | the scale kind, `categorical`, the only one so far and the default         |
| `domain`  | values in legend order, each taking the `range` color at its index         |
| `range`   | a palette name or a list of colors; the ggplot palette when both are unset |
| `title`   | the legend's title; records with the same members and title share a scale  |

| Channel        | What it sets                                                  | Reads a field of |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `tipLabel`     | the color of each tip label in the tree                       | `rowData`        |
| `rowTint`      | a wash over the row, across the tree gutter and the alignment | `rowData`        |
| `branch`       | the color of a tree edge whose tips all share one value       | `rowData`        |
| `featureFill`  | the fill of each span of the annotation overlay               | the `gff`        |
| `featureLabel` | the text drawn inside a span                                  | the `gff`        |

A palette name in `range` is one of `ggplot` (the default), `set1`, `dark2`,
`okabeito` and `tableau`, with `okabeIto` and `tableau10` read as aliases. The
scale hands its colors to the field's distinct values: the values `domain` lists
first, in that order, then the rest in natural order, numbers by value and digit
runs by magnitude, so `2` sorts before `10` and `2.3.2.1a` before `2.3.4.4b`. A
value keeps its color as rows are collapsed, filtered or re-ordered. Past the
end of a named palette every value takes an evenly spaced hue instead, which
keeps a forty-clade field readable.

A list of colors in `range` colors as many values as it holds, so a `domain` and
a `range` of one length color the values they name, and a value they leave out
keeps the plain mark: an uncolored tip label draws in the theme's text color, an
uncolored row takes no tint, and an uncolored span draws grey.

A snapshot written before the color object reads the same:

- `scale: {palette}` reads as `range`
- `scale: {map}` reads as `domain` and `range`
- a strip's `legend` reads as `title`
- a column track's `colors` reads as `encoding.color`, and its `max` as
  `scales.y.domainMax`

A tint draws at 25% opacity so the residues under it stay readable. A color
carrying its own alpha, such as `rgba(228,26,28,0.5)`, draws at that alpha.

The `branch` channel gives an internal node the field's value when every tip
below it shares that value, and that node's edge and every edge inside the clade
draw in the scale's color for it. An edge whose tips disagree draws in the
default color, and a collapsed clade's triangle takes the color of the value its
tips agree on. This is ggtree's `groupClade` followed by `aes(color = group)`,
with the group read from the table.

Every scale an encoding reads carries a legend, titled by `title` or else the
field name, drawn by the overlay on screen and reserved as a column in the SVG
export. Two channels declaring the same members over one field list it once.

### The feature channels

A feature channel reads any field of the feature table: `accession`, `name`,
`featureType`, any GFF attribute of column 9, such as `Name` or `gene`, or any
field of a `features` record.

[![](media/layers-featurechannels.png)][live-layers-featurechannels]

Ten Src-family kinases with their InterPro Pfam matches, both feature channels
reading the GFF's `description` attribute: `featureFill` colors each span from a
`set1` scale and `featureLabel` draws the same value inside it.

```json
{
  "type": "MsaView",
  "data": {
    "msa": ">duck\nMKAANSE\n>chicken\nMKA-NSE",
    "gff": "##gff-version 3\nduck\tncbi\tgene\t1\t5\t.\t+\t.\tName=HA;class=surface\nchicken\tncbi\tgene\t1\t4\t.\t+\t.\tName=NP;class=internal;color=255,0,0"
  },
  "encodings": [
    { "channel": "featureFill", "field": "class", "range": "set1" },
    { "channel": "featureLabel", "field": "Name" }
  ]
}
```

The `featureFill` scale replaces the accession palette the overlay colors spans
by, so a span whose value the scale gives no color draws grey, and the domain
legend lists that scale's values under the field's name. A feature carrying a
GFF3 `color=` attribute keeps that color whatever the scale says, and `255,0,0`
reads as `rgb(255,0,0)`, the convention JBrowse and IGV honor. A `featureLabel`
draws inside its span wherever the text fits, and it is a data channel, so it
draws whether or not the residue letters do.

## customColorScheme

A color per residue letter, which replaces the built-in color scheme while it is
set. The letters the map lists take its colors, and every other letter is
uncolored, the rule a `domain` and `range` in `encodings` follow.

```json
{
  "type": "MsaView",
  "data": { "msa": ">human\nMKAANSE\n>mouse\nMKA-NSE" },
  "customColorScheme": {
    "K": "#1f77b4",
    "R": "#1f77b4",
    "D": "#d62728",
    "E": "#d62728"
  }
}
```

[Open this snapshot in the app][live-layers-customcolorscheme].

The viewer upper-cases every row before coloring it, as the built-in schemes
expect, so a key matches its letter in either case. A gap is uncolored unless
the map lists `-` or `.`. The map paints whichever channel `residueEncoding`
picks, the cell or the letter, and it colors the sequence logo's letters too.
Picking a scheme under **Settings → Color** clears the map.

React: `colorScheme={{ domain: ['K'], range: ['#1f77b4'] }}` on `MSAViewer`, or
`model.setCustomColorScheme(map)`. R: `color_scheme = c(K = "#1f77b4")`, or
`scale_residue_color(c(K = "#1f77b4"))`. Python:
`color_scheme={"K": "#1f77b4"}`.

## rowPanels

A panel beside the tree on the row scale, the counterpart of `columnTracks` on
the column scale. Each record names a `kind`. A `strip` reads a field of
`rowData` and colors each row's cell through its color object, and eight strips
make the tip-aligned matrix ggtree draws with `gheatmap`. A `features` panel
draws the spans `gff` carries, one row per alignment row, which is gggenes.

[![](media/layers-rowpanels.png)][live-layers-rowpanels]

Nine strips between the tree and the alignment: the phenotype of each allele,
then the residue it carries at each of eight Ambler positions. The eight
position strips share one `title`, so the matrix carries a single key for its
residue colors.

```json
{
  "type": "MsaView",
  "data": {
    "msa": ">duck\nMKAANSE\n>chicken\nMKA-NSE",
    "treeMetadata": "{\"duck\":{\"HA\":\"H5\",\"NA\":\"N1\"},\"chicken\":{\"HA\":\"H5\",\"NA\":\"N8\"}}"
  },
  "rowPanels": [
    { "kind": "strip", "field": "HA", "range": "set1", "width": 12 },
    { "kind": "strip", "field": "NA", "header": "NA segment" }
  ]
}
```

| Field    | Meaning                                                                    |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kind`   | `strip` or `features`                                                      |
| `field`  | the `rowData` field a strip's cells read                                   |
| `domain` | a strip's values in legend order, as in `encodings`                        |
| `range`  | a palette name or a list of colors; the ggplot palette when both are unset |
| `title`  | the title a strip's values list under, defaulting to its field             |
| `width`  | the column's pixel width: a row height for a strip, 200 for features       |
| `header` | the name drawn above the column, defaulting to a strip's field             |

The panels take their width out of the alignment's, so the alignment scrolls and
fits within what is left. A strip scrolls with the tree and the alignment, and a
row the table gives no value leaves its cell empty.

Each header draws in the band the tree's scale bar and the minimap share, turned
on its side, and it exports with the figure. The band is as tall as the minimap,
so a longer header is clipped to it and the full name is the column's tooltip.

A panel's scale carries a legend of its own, titled by the field, and every
panel and encoding declaring the same members over one field lists it once.
Eight columns over one set of colors read eight fields, so give them one
`title`. The strips then share one scale over every value the eight fields take,
a value two segments carry draws one color in both, and the figure carries one
key for the matrix:

```json
"rowPanels": [
  { "kind": "strip", "field": "PB2", "range": "set1", "title": "segment lineage" },
  { "kind": "strip", "field": "PB1", "range": "set1", "title": "segment lineage" }
]
```

A `features` panel taking the overlay's colors lists them under the same key the
overlay draws, and with no alignment behind it the panel's own entries are that
key.

React: the `rowPanels` prop on `MSAViewer`, or `model.setRowPanels(list)`. R:
`geom_msa_strip("HA", range = "set1", width = 12, title = "amino acid")` and
`geom_msa_features(color = "Name", label = "Name", align = "genE")`. Python: the
`row_panels` trait.

### The features panel

A `features` record draws the same spans the alignment's overlay draws, in a
column of its own: an arrow where the GFF gives a gene a strand, a box
otherwise, labeled where the text fits. Features that overlap within a row stack
into lanes, which divide the row's height between them.

[![](media/layers-featurespanel.png)][live-layers-featurespanel]

Twelve bacterial genomes around `trpB`, with no alignment at all: a tree, a GFF
and one `features` panel under `x: "position"`. The `align` transform starts
`trpB` at one x down the panel, and `encoding.color` reads the GFF's `role`
attribute while `encoding.label` reads `Name`.

| Field       | Meaning                                                                                   |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `x`         | `column` draws in the alignment's columns; `position` in each row's own residue positions |
| `encoding`  | `{color: {field, range, domain, title}, label: field}` over a field of the features       |
| `transform` | `[{type: "align", on: <Name value>}]`, only under `x: "position"`                         |
| `position`  | `identity` stacks overlapping features; `strandpile` splits the row by strand             |

`x: "position"` maps every row's features onto one linear scale across the
extent they cover, so a genome with no alignment has an x. With no `msa` the
alignment panel is zero columns wide, and the tree and the panel fill the view.

`{type: "align", on: "genE"}` shifts each row so that the first feature whose
`Name` is `genE` starts at zero, which is gggenes' `make_alignment_dummies`. A
row carrying no such feature keeps its own origin. An `align` under
`x: "column"` draws nothing different, since the columns are the alignment's.

`encoding.color` reads any field of the feature table, the same fields a
`featureFill` encoding reads. A record naming none takes the colors the overlay
gives the same features, and `encoding.label` falls back to the `featureLabel`
encoding the same way. A feature's own GFF `color=` wins over either.

[![](media/layers-strandpile.png)][live-layers-strandpile]

The same panel under `position: "strandpile"`, which separates the divergently
transcribed neighbours that read as one more arrow in a row under `identity`.

`position: "strandpile"` is gggenomes' `position_strandpile`. Each strand packs
on its own, and the deepest row on each side sets the grid every row lays out
on, so the line between the strands sits at one height down the panel. A row
using only one side leaves the other empty, and a feature with no strand piles
with the forward ones.

```json
{
  "type": "MsaView",
  "data": {
    "tree": "((genome1:0.1,genome2:0.1):0.2,genome3:0.3);",
    "gff": "##gff-version 3\ngenome1\tncbi\tgene\t1\t500\t.\t+\t.\tName=genD\ngenome1\tncbi\tgene\t600\t1000\t.\t+\t.\tName=genE\ngenome2\tncbi\tgene\t200\t700\t.\t+\t.\tName=genE\ngenome3\tncbi\tgene\t1\t400\t.\t-\t.\tName=genD"
  },
  "rowPanels": [

        "color": { "field": "Name", "range": "set1" },
        "label": "Name"
      },

    }
  ]
}
```

## residueMappings

A residue mapping records which residue of which structure each residue of a row
corresponds to. Unlike the layers above, `residueMappings` draws nothing; the
model reads it to answer lookups. The host has to supply it, because matching a
row to a structure by sequence equality fails for a construct with an expression
tag, a truncation, an engineered residue, or a row that is a subsequence of the
entry. The highlight then lands on a real residue, just the wrong one. A
producer such as SIFTS, an AlphaFold model or a curator computes the
correspondence.

```json
"residueMappings": [
  {
    "row": "HBA_HUMAN/1-142",
    "accession": "P69905",
    "structure": {
      "id": "1A3N",
      "kind": "experimental",
      "asymId": "A",
      "url": "https://files.rcsb.org/download/1A3N.cif"
    },
    "segments": [
      { "rowStart": 1, "rowEnd": 141, "structStart": 2, "structEnd": 142 }
    ],
    "unobserved": [[60, 62]],
    "rowLength": 142,
    "generated": { "by": "sifts", "date": "2026-09-10" }
  }
]
```

| Field        | Meaning                                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `row`        | The alignment row this maps                                              |
| `accession`  | The sequence database entry the mapping went through, for provenance     |
| `structure`  | `id`, plus optional `kind`, `asymId` (the chain), `asymIdKind` and `url` |
| `segments`   | Contiguous runs where the two sides line up 1:1                          |
| `unobserved` | Structure positions declared but not resolved, as `[start, end]`         |
| `rowLength`  | Ungapped length of the row it was computed against; always set it        |
| `generated`  | Who computed it, when, and from what                                     |

`asymIdKind` says which id `asymId` is, `label` for the file's `label_asym_id`
or `auth` for the author's `auth_asym_id`. With none set a reader tries the
label id and then the author id, which is wrong for an entry where the two
collide, such as 7K00's author chain `X`, which is label `AB`. A mapping that
names no chain applies to every chain.

Positions are 1-based and inclusive on both sides, as everywhere else in this
document. Structure positions are `label_seq_id`, the index into the entity's
SEQRES. Author numbering carries insertion codes, which break integer
arithmetic, so the layer does not use it.

A mapping is a few contiguous runs, and the segments define what is unmapped, so
the layer needs no status field that could contradict them. A position is in one
of three states:

- covered by a segment and not in `unobserved`: mapped and observed
- covered and listed in `unobserved`: mapped, not observed
- anything else: unmapped

The middle state separates "the crystallographer could not see this residue"
from "this protein has no such residue".

Two model methods read it:

```ts
model.structureResidue(rowName, seqPos, structureId?) // -> {structure, position, observed} | undefined
model.rowResidue(structureId, position, asymId?) // -> {rowName, seqPos} | undefined
```

Both return `undefined` when no mapping covers the position, **and also when
more than one does**. A row commonly maps onto several structures, such as an
experimental entry and a couple of predicted models, and a homodimer maps two
rows onto two chains of one id. Returning the first mapping found would place
the answer on a wrong residue with no error. Name one structure or chain with
the optional argument, or read `mappedStructures` to see what is available.

### Staleness

A host can load a saved mapping against a re-aligned, revised or different
sequence, and every lookup would then return a wrong residue with no error.
Before answering, the viewer checks each mapping and stops using it when any of
these holds:

- The row it names is not in the alignment.
- `rowLength` is declared and does not match the row's ungapped length. No other
  check catches a same-length substitution, so a producer should always set it.
- A segment covers residues past the end of the row, which shows the same
  mismatch when `rowLength` is missing.

When a segment is malformed, its two sides differing in length so it cannot be a
1:1 run, the viewer drops only that segment and keeps using the rest of the
mapping.

`model.residueMappingProblems` lists each mapping or segment the viewer dropped,
with a `scope` (`mapping` or `segment`) and a reason, so a host can tell "there
is no structure for this row" from "this data no longer matches what is loaded".
`model.usableResidueMappings` holds the mappings that passed.

`packages/examples/src/examples/kinaseStructure.json` is a real mapping,
generated by `scripts/examples-gen/contacts.mjs` from SIFTS: the SRC_HUMAN row
against chain A of 2SRC, one segment putting row residue 86 at structure residue
2, one unobserved range, and `rowLength: 536`. The
[spike_structure tutorial](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/tutorials/spike_structure)
builds another from scratch, against a construct whose numbering is offset by 19
and whose furin loop has no coordinates at all.

`seqPos` is 1-based, like the rest of this document, and composes directly with
`applyHighlight`. The column helpers on the model (`seqPosToVisibleCol`) take
0-based positions, so a structure hover reaches a column as
`model.seqPosToVisibleCol(rowName, seqPos - 1)`.

### Generating a mapping

`react-msaview-cli residue-mappings` writes this layer from SIFTS for a PDB
chain, or from AlphaFold DB for a predicted model. It checks each row against
its UniProt sequence first, maps a `/start-end` row as that fragment, and sets
`rowLength`, `unobserved` and `generated`. The
[CLI README](https://github.com/GMOD/JBrowseMSA/tree/main/packages/cli#residue-mappings)
lists its options.

```bash
react-msaview-cli residue-mappings --msa spike.afa --row SARS-CoV-2 \
  --accession P0DTC2 --pdb 6VXX --chain A -o mappings.json
```
