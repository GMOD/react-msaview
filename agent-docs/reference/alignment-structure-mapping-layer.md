# The alignment ↔ structure correspondence as a layer

A snapshot layer names which structure residue each alignment residue
corresponds to, computed once by a producer such as SIFTS, an AlphaFold model or
a curator. The viewer looks the correspondence up and returns nothing when there
is no entry. This follows [layers that take data](data-layers.md), where an
agent computes a value and the snapshot stores it for the viewer to draw.

Background reading that prompted this: `~/ideas/sequence-structure-interop.md`,
local and deliberately outside the repo.

## Status, 2026-09-24

Every step has shipped or gone. When this note was written,
jbrowse-plugin-protein3d matched a structure to the alignment row whose ungapped
sequence equalled the structure's, and fell back to `col === seqPos` when none
did, which lit a real residue, just the wrong one. protein3d's `137bb13`
(2026-09-13) deleted that bridge, `msaRowMatch.ts` and
`ProteinToMsaHoverSync.tsx` both. A hover now passes through the genome:
protein3d reads msaview's `connectedHoverHighlights`, the codon under the
hovered column, and maps it genome to transcript to structure the way it maps a
genome hover (`src/ProteinView/connectedHover.ts`), and msaview mirrors a
structure hover onto its columns the same way. That path needs a genome view
both plugins connect to.

`residueMappings` serves the case with no genome: an alignment and a structure
on one page, such as `/tutorials/structure_link` on this site, which reads
`structureResidue` and `rowResidue` directly.

## The layer

A snapshot field naming the correspondence per row:

```json
"residueMappings": [
  {
    "row": "HBA_HUMAN/1-142",
    "accession": "P69905",
    "structure": {
      "id": "1A3N",
      "kind": "experimental",
      "asymId": "A",
      "url": "https://files.rcsb.org/download/1A3N.cif"
    },
    "segments": [{ "rowStart": 1, "rowEnd": 141, "structStart": 2, "structEnd": 142 }],
    "unobserved": [[1, 1], [140, 142]],
    "generated": { "by": "sifts", "date": "2026-09-10", "sourceSha256": "b8e77aba…" }
  }
]
```

**Key by row residue, not by alignment column.** Columns move under `hideGaps`,
under collapsing, and under any re-alignment, so a column-keyed table goes stale
the first time a user hides gappy columns. Row residue positions do not move,
the viewer already projects them through `seqPosToVisibleCol`, and every other
layer keys the same way: GFF features, `highlights` with a `row`, and
`columnTracks` whose `values` index a named row's residues.

**Segments, because SIFTS uses segments.** `UniProtStructureSegment` in
protein3d is already `{unpStart, unpEnd, structStart, structEnd}`; this layer
uses the same fields with the alignment row in place of a UniProt accession. A
dozen numbers covers a case that a dense per-residue array would spend kilobytes
on. Segments also define unmapped: **a position no segment covers is unmapped.**

**The segment geometry encodes three states, so the layer has no status field.**
A position a segment covers is mapped and observed. A position listed in
`unobserved` is present in SEQRES with no coordinates. That state matters to a
user, because "the crystallographer could not see it" and "this protein does not
have that residue" mean different things. Any other position is unmapped and
draws nothing. With no status enum, producers and the viewer have no vocabulary
that could drift apart.

**Positions are 1-based inclusive on both sides**, as GFF and `highlights` are.
Structure positions are `label_seq_id`, the 1-based index into the entity's
SEQRES, which is protein3d's native coordinate plus one. The layer leaves author
numbering out: it carries insertion codes, so `100A` sorts between `100` and
`101` and integer arithmetic on it is wrong. The structure viewer can derive
auth numbering for display.

The API consists of two model methods:

```ts
structureResidue(rowName, seqPos): { structure, position, observed } | undefined
rowResidue(structureId, position): { rowName, seqPos } | undefined
```

Two lookups cover the need, not a general coordinate-translation framework. This
repo has three coordinate spaces (visible column, global column, row residue),
no cycles between them, and one consumer.

## Owner-keyed highlights

`highlightedColumns` is one transient volatile slot. protein3d hover, a genome
view and a future search all write it, and the last clear erases the others.
Replace the slot with a map:

```ts
applyHighlight(owner: string, highlights: Highlight[])
clearHighlight(owner: string)
```

backed by a `Map<string, Highlight[]>` volatile that `resolvedHighlights` merges
alongside the persisted `highlights` array. `setHighlightedColumns` stays as the
legacy single owner, so downstream callers keep working.

**Done** (`applyHighlight`/`clearHighlight` in `model.ts`, tests in
`highlights.test.ts`). `resolvedHighlights` merges the owner map over the
persisted `highlights` array, so a transient highlight resolves through the same
row projection as a document one and draws above it. `reset()` drops the map
because a hover belongs to the file that was open. `setHighlightedColumns` was
left as it was: it is a cross-repo contract with jbrowse-plugin-msaview and
renders through a different path, so `applyHighlight` sits beside it. Its
callers should migrate.

## What it unlocks

[Conservation on 3D structure](conservation-on-structure.md) becomes wiring with
no lookup step on a page that holds both viewers. `/tutorials/structure_link`
has that wiring behind a checkbox.

A **multi-structure overlay** becomes possible without a structural aligner.
Take the columns where two rows both map to observed residues, feed those
C-alpha pairs to Kabsch, and ship the resulting 4×4 matrix as data beside the
mapping. The alignment already asserts which residues correspond, so fitting on
exactly those pairs derives the overlay from the alignment. The fit is also
reproducible from the snapshot, where a superposition tool's run is not. The
overlay belongs in protein3d, with the mapping layer as its input.

Tooltips can report the per-cell state. With three states in the data, a tooltip
can say "P69905 · residue 58 · not observed in 1A3N".

## Out of scope

A general coordinate-translation framework, meaning registered translators, a
path planner between arbitrary spaces, and a status vocabulary spanning them.
That framework generalizes the two methods above and pays off when third parties
register hops you did not write, which nobody does here.

Fetching SIFTS from the viewer. The mapping arrives in the snapshot or it does
not exist, in line with the sources rule: lookups and precomputation, not a
service call on the render path.

A dense per-cell mapping matrix, for the same reason
[data-layers](data-layers.md) rejects a per-cell color matrix. SIFTS and model
mappings are contiguous segments in every case seen so far.

## Order

1. ~~**Delete the 1:1 fallback in protein3d.**~~ Done downstream: protein3d's
   `137bb13` removed the whole sequence-matching bridge.
2. ~~**Owner-keyed highlights here.**~~ Done, see above.
3. ~~**`residueMappings` plus the two lookup methods.**~~ Done. The layer, the
   types and `structureResidue`/`rowResidue` are in `model.ts`, documented in
   `docs/layers.md`, tested in `residueMappings.test.ts`.

   The prototype review in `~/ideas/sequence-structure-interop.md` settled three
   questions this file left open. **Both lookups take an optional selector and
   return undefined when the answer is not unique.** A row mapped onto four
   structures is that review's own worked example, and returning the first
   mapping is the ambiguity-reported-as-exact fault it criticises.
   **`unobserved` is in structure positions**, so a residue can be unobserved
   and outside the mapped region at once; the example range in this file implies
   that without stating it. **The viewer ignores a stale mapping.** The review's
   sharpest criticism is that the digest check stops at the fixture boundary and
   never travels with the data, and a mapping loaded against a re-aligned or
   revised sequence returns a wrong residue for every query. `rowLength` is the
   cheap declared check, a segment overrunning the row is the undeclared one,
   and `residueMappingProblems` lists why each mapping was ignored.

   Three generators write the layer from a SIFTS lookup.
   `scripts/examples-gen/structure.mjs` builds the mapping for the Src,
   sickle-cell hemoglobin and ACE2-spike examples, and
   `docs/tutorials/scripts/build_spike_structure.sh` and
   `build_protein_complex.sh` write one for the spike and hemoglobin tutorials.
   `react-msaview-cli residue-mappings` writes the layer for any alignment.

4. ~~**A published locus type and hover/select callbacks.**~~ Moot: protein3d no
   longer reads `mouseCol` or calls `setMousePos`, since both hover directions
   pass through the genome view.

## Notes

`conservation-on-structure.md` cited `website/src/lib/proteinStl.ts` for
in-browser AlphaFold fetching. That file no longer exists, and the citation
there has been corrected.
