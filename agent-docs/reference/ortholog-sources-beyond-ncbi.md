# Ortholog sources beyond NCBI

The gene explorer's non-human sessions and the msaview plugin's `orthologParams`
launch take their ortholog set from NCBI Datasets, whose sets are vertebrate-
and insect-scoped. (The two are one code path since the website started emitting
the request instead of building the alignment.) Measured on 2026-08-25: human
TP53 → 658 orthologs; fly Antp → 108, all insects; yeast CDC28 → 3, all yeast.
Four of the seven species the page offers (yeast, worm, fly in practice,
Arabidopsis) therefore cannot build an alignment. This note measures the
alternatives and picks one, and the pick has shipped; see [Shipped](#shipped).

The fetchers live in jbrowse-plugin-msaview. The gene explorer, with the website
files this note cites (`ebiAlign.ts`, `scripts/gene-explorer/`), was deleted on
2026-08-27, and the note stays for its measurements of each source.

## Measurements

Every probe ran from a dev box on 2026-08-25 with `Origin: https://gmod.org`
set, since the page is a static site with no proxy: a source without
`access-control-allow-origin: *` (ACAO) is unusable. Coverage means the seven
explorer species: human 9606, mouse 10090, zebrafish 7955, fly 7227, worm 6239,
yeast 559292, Arabidopsis 3702.

On stability, PANTHER publishes a numbered release a year (19 today), has run
the same `services/oai` endpoints since 2019, and is the GO consortium's
enrichment backend. Its docs sit behind a Cloudflare challenge, so the rate
limit is unpublished, and none of the probes above needed a key. OMA versions
its API (`api/version/`) and its data release, and the two slow calls above show
it also stalls. Ensembl's own
[status feed](https://www.ensembl.info/category/07-status/) records mirror
outages in January 2026 and a beta outage in June 2026, and the project is
migrating to a new platform. The 35 s ping and the 503 above measure what a user
of the page would see.

## Recommendation

Use PANTHER as the primary source and OMA as the fallback. PANTHER takes the
page's own inputs, a gene symbol and a taxon id, returns a UniProt accession per
target species in under a second, covers every species the page offers and 137
more, and its `LDO` flag is a defensible one-to-one pick where one exists.
Sequences come from one UniProt batch call. PANTHER returns a gene it cannot map
in `unmapped_ids`, and OMA covers that case: it takes the UniProt accession the
page already has, and `protein/<acc>/orthologs/` plus `bulk_retrieve` gives rows
with the same fields, choosing per taxon the row with the best `rel_type`
(`1:1` > `1:n` > `m:1` > `m:n`) and lowest `distance`. OMA is second rather than
first because its pairwise sets drop whole clades for many-to-many families
(Antp: 76 insects, no vertebrate), where PANTHER still lists 26 orthologs.

OrthoDB is not worth adding. Its single `fasta` call is the most convenient
response of any source, but the group level decides what comes back, and at the
level that spans yeast to human the groups are either families rather than
orthologs (Antp) or missing the reference species (CDC28, no human gene). A
narrower level fixes one query and breaks the next.

We rejected Ensembl on the numbers above, not on principle. It is the one source
that returns an alignment, and if the REST host were reliable it would replace
the EBI Clustal Omega step. Re-measure it after the platform migration finishes.

Neither PANTHER nor OMA returns an alignment, so the aligner stays: EBI Clustal
Omega on the website (`ebiAlign.ts`), `launchMSA` in the plugin.

## Where the fetcher goes

The plugin is the better place. `doLaunchOrthologs.ts` already handles the query
row, the labels, the tree metadata and the aligner, and the website is moving
towards emitting `orthologParams` instead of building the alignment itself. The
integration point is `fetchOrthologRows` in `src/utils/ncbiOrthologs.ts`, whose
rows are
`{ label, taxId, geneId, protein, sequence, scientificName, commonName }`. A
`source: 'ncbi' | 'panther'` on `OrthologParams` (default `ncbi`, so every
existing link keeps its meaning) would pick the fetcher; the PANTHER fetcher
needs the symbol and taxon, which `geneCandidates[0]` and `taxId` already carry.
Two things differ per row: `geneId` is a UniProt accession rather than an NCBI
GeneID, and the `Accession` metadata that drives the CDD domain overlay
(`autoLoadProteinDomains`) is a RefSeq accession today. That fetcher
(`utils/ncbiDomains.ts`) reads Region features out of GenPept records pulled by
accession through `efetch`, which also serves Swiss-Prot accessions, so the
overlay probably still works; confirm on one TrEMBL accession before attaching
them.

## Shipped

jbrowse-plugin-msaview 3.3.0 ships PANTHER. `source: 'ncbi' | 'panther'` on
`OrthologParams` defaults to `ncbi` and dispatches to
`src/utils/pantherOrthologs.ts`, which returns rows with the same fields as
`fetchOrthologRows`, so the query row, the labels, the aligner and the CDD
overlay take the same rows regardless of source. A **Source** select on the
Orthologs tab offers the same choice interactively, remembered in local storage.
The gene explorer emitted `source: 'panther'` for fly, worm, Arabidopsis and
yeast until it was deleted.

The CDD overlay question this note left open is settled: `efetch` serves a
Swiss-Prot accession as a GenPept record with CDD Regions, exactly as it serves
a RefSeq one, and returns HTTP 400 for a TrEMBL accession. A mixed batch returns
the Swiss-Prot records and drops the rest, so domains land on the reviewed rows
and the alignment is unaffected either way.

The prototype module this note was written around,
`website/src/lib/orthologs/panther.ts`, is deleted. The plugin builds the
alignment, and a second copy of the same fetcher in the website would only
attract edits to the unused one.

NCBI stays the default. Further species coverage belongs in the hosted-alignment
path (`msaIndexedLocation`), which needs no per-source code.

## UniRef, 2026-09-05

A third source landed, for a different query from the two above: instead of
"this gene's ortholog per species", it lists "everything in UniProtKB within 50%
identity of this protein", which UniProt has already clustered.
`source: 'uniref'` in the plugin resolves the gene or a UniProt accession, finds
its UniRef50 (or 90) cluster, and lists the members one per species, reference
proteomes by default, from rest.uniprot.org (CORS `*`). Human TP53: 191 members,
129 in reference proteomes, about two seconds. Paired with
`msaAlgorithm: 'browser'` the launch makes no EBI call; on the day the source
was built, EBI took 12 to 15 minutes per phmmer job. A cluster cannot reach
remote homologs, so phmmer stays for that; both are session-spec sources
(`orthologParams`, `searchParams`) and jb2hubs' protein browser offers each.
