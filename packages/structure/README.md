# react-msaview-structure

- **In:** a `react-msaview` model, and a row's UniProt accession
- **Out:** the AlphaFold and PDB structures of that row with the residue mapping
  onto each, and a Mol\* panel linked to the alignment

## Find a row's structures

```ts
import { findStructures } from 'react-msaview-structure'

const { candidates, problem } = await findStructures({
  rowName: 'sp|P04637|P53_HUMAN',
  rowSequence: model.rowSequence('sp|P04637|P53_HUMAN') ?? '',
})
model.setResidueMappings([...model.residueMappings, candidates[0].mapping])
```

- The row names its UniProt entry, or the caller passes `accession`
- A row named by an entry name (`HBA_HUMAN`) or a RefSeq protein id
  (`NP_000549.1`) is looked up in UniProt by that name, a reviewed entry first,
  and `resolvedFrom` in the result says which name it came from
- The row is then checked against the entry it resolved to, so a wrong name gets
  no mapping
- AlphaFold DB and RCSB answer the lookups, both from the browser
- The row is aligned once to the entry's canonical sequence, and each
  candidate's `segments` compose that alignment with the structure's own
  numbering (`label_seq_id`)
- A row that does not match its entry gets no candidates and a `problem`
- A generated mapping names its chain by the author id RCSB reports

## Search Foldseek for a row with no identifier

```ts
import {
  foldseekCandidates,
  foldseekQuery,
  searchFoldseek,
} from 'react-msaview-structure'

const rowSequence = model.rowSequence('Human_alpha') ?? ''
const hits = await searchFoldseek({
  sequence: foldseekQuery(rowSequence).sequence,
  onStatus: status => console.log(status),
})
const candidates = foldseekCandidates({
  rowName: 'Human_alpha',
  rowSequence,
  hits,
})
```

- This sends the sequence to `3di.foldseek.com` and `search.foldseek.com` and
  waits for their queue, about 8 s for a 142-residue protein, so a host offers
  it as an explicit action
- Foldseek aligns the query to each hit, and that alignment is the residue
  mapping, so a hit is a structural homolog and its `identity` says how close
- The query is the row's twenty standard amino acids, at most 1200 of them, and
  hits map back to the row's own numbering through the residues left out
- An AlphaFold F1 hit opens from its own file, since it is numbered on the
  UniProt sequence
- A PDB hit is drawn from its CA trace, numbered by target position, because the
  database holds only the residues with coordinates and its position is not
  SEQRES numbering. The trace travels in the mapping as a `data:` URL

## Superpose rows by the alignment

```ts
import { superposeRows } from 'react-msaview-structure'

const fit = await superposeRows({
  model,
  targets: [
    { row: 'HBA_HUMAN', structureId: 'AF-P69905-F1' },
    { row: 'HBB_HUMAN', structureId: 'AF-P68871-F1' },
  ],
  columns: { start: 30, end: 60 },
})
```

- The alignment says which residues correspond: each other row's CA atoms fit
  the first row's where both rows have one, in `columns` when given
- `matrices` moves each structure into the reference's frame, for the panel's
  `transforms`, and each fit reports its RMSD and the CA pairs it used
- `distanceValues` is the mean CA distance per residue of the reference row
  after the fit, which is a `columnTracks` bar's `values`
- Fitting a pocket and reading the distances elsewhere shows where the rest of
  the fold departs from it
- A fit sets aside the pairs that sit more than twice the RMSD from it and fits
  again, up to five rounds and never below 40% of the pairs, as PyMOL's `align`
  does, so a loop the alignment mismatched does not pull the core out of
  register. `fitted` of `considered` pairs says how many it kept, and
  `refine: false` keeps them all
- Structure files are read as mmCIF, and the first model's `ATOM` CA records
  count

## Facets: structures side by side

```tsx
import { facetsByRowField } from 'react-msaview-structure'
import { FacetGrid } from 'react-msaview-structure/panel'

const facets = facetsByRowField(model, 'group')
;<FacetGrid
  model={model}
  facets={facets}
  transforms={fit.matrices}
  columns={4}
/>
```

- A facet is a group of rows, from a field of the row table or from your own
  grouping with `facetsOfGroups`, with the structures those rows map onto
- Each facet is its own Mol\* view, so a grid suits a handful of groups
- Pass the matrices of one `superposeRows` fit over every facet's structures, so
  all facets share a frame, and the cameras are tied so turning one turns all
- A structure shows in its facet's color where the alignment covers it and pale
  where it does not, so a disordered tail or an unaligned domain recedes

## Show the structure

```tsx
import { StructurePanel } from 'react-msaview-structure/panel'
;<StructurePanel model={model} structureId="AF-P04637-F1" colorBy="scheme" />
```

- Hovering the alignment lights the mapped structure residue, and hovering the
  structure lights its cell
- Clicking either side focuses the other
- `colorBy` paints the structure with `conservation`, or with the alignment's
  own `scheme`
- `structureIds` shows several structures, each in its own color unless
  `colorBy` is set, and `transforms` places them
- `highlights` (on by default) paints the residues the alignment's `highlights`
  layer marks, on top of the rest, through the rows that map onto the structure
- `fitBy="tm-align"` superposes by the structures' traces alone and reports
  TM-score and RMSD through `onTmAlign`
- The view frames the residues the alignment covers, so a tail does not set the
  zoom
- `molstar` is a peer dependency, and the panel loads it on first mount
