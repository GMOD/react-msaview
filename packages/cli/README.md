# react-msaview-cli

Annotate a multiple sequence alignment and render it to a publication figure,
from the command line, with no browser in the loop.

The CLI has two groups of commands, and the second draws what the first writes:

- **Annotate**: build a domain or exon GFF for an alignment, from InterPro's
  precomputed matches (`interpro`), a live InterProScan run (`interproscan`), or
  a RefSeq transcript's exon model (`genestructure`), and relate rows to 3D
  structures (`residue-mappings`).
- **Render**: draw the alignment, its tree, and those annotations to a
  standalone SVG, PNG or PDF (`export-svg`). The command runs the web viewer's
  renderer headlessly, so the figure matches what the app shows.

## Prerequisites

- NodeJS v22+

`export-svg`, `interpro` and `residue-mappings` need nothing else, except that
`export-svg` writes PNG and PDF through `rsvg-convert` from librsvg.
`interproscan` needs a backend to scan with: the EBI web API (the default, no
install), Docker, Singularity, or a local InterProScan (see
[interproscan](#interproscan)).

`export-svg` draws the alignment background as one embedded image when
[@napi-rs/canvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@napi-rs/canvas) is present. The
package is an optional dependency with prebuilt binaries, so a normal install
brings it in. On a platform with no prebuilt binary, the export draws a
rectangle per cell, which makes a much larger file and runs slower on big
alignments.

## Setup

```bash
npm install -g react-msaview-cli
```

From a clone of the monorepo instead:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter react-msaview-cli build
```

## Quickstart

An Src-family kinase alignment with its tree and Pfam domains, rendered in two
commands. The first asks InterPro for the domains of each row; the second draws
the figure.

```bash
react-msaview-cli interpro accessions.tsv -o domains.gff

react-msaview-cli export-svg --msa kinases.aln --tree kinases.nwk \
  --gff domains.gff --col-width 1.6 --row-height 14 --tree-area-width 200 \
  -o kinases.svg
```

![Src-family kinases: tree, SH3/SH2/kinase domain architecture, and the color key](../../docs/media/cli-domains.png)

The domain architecture reads straight down the alignment: SH3, then SH2, then
the catalytic domain. The renderer draws every row in the alignment's column
space, so each domain lands in the same columns in every row. The key on the
right lists the domains present in the GFF.

Every figure on this page is `export-svg` output, drawn from the Src-kinase and
GPCR examples in
[packages/examples](https://github.com/GMOD/JBrowseMSA/tree/main/packages/examples/data).

<!-- /options -->

### Tracks

`--tracks` names the tracks to draw above the alignment, by id, or `all` for
every one this alignment has: `conservation`, `property-conservation` (protein
only), `sequence-logo`, `position-ruler`, `base-pairs` (a Stockholm `SS_cons`
line), and any track ids the file itself carries. The CLI reports a name that
matches no track.

```bash
react-msaview-cli export-svg --msa kinases.aln --tracks conservation,position-ruler \
  -o kinases.svg
```

### Layers

`--spec` takes an `MsaView` snapshot or its shorthand as a JSON file, so any
layer in [the layers reference](https://gmod.org/JBrowseMSA/layers) draws in the
figure: column tracks, highlights, clades, row panels, encodings. A spec that
sets `msa`, `tree`, or a filehandle's `uri` to a relative path reads it beside
the spec file, and an `http(s)` one fetches it. `--msa` is then optional, and
every flag given on the command line overrides the spec. The figure draws the
tracks the app would show for the spec, unless `--tracks` names them.

```bash
react-msaview-cli export-svg --spec p53-view.json -o p53.svg
```

### Sizing the figure

`export-svg` draws the **entire** alignment unless `--viewport` asks for the
`--width` x `--height` window at the top left, so the output is normally as wide
as the alignment is long. `--width` and `--height` size the viewport the model
lays out in, not the figure. `--col-width` and `--row-height` scale the figure:

```bash
## a 90-column alignment at the default 12px columns: letters are legible
react-msaview-cli export-svg --msa gpcrs.fa -o gpcrs.svg
```

![Four GPCR rows with residue letters and a Pfam domain box](../../docs/media/cli-letters.png)

```bash
## an 856-column alignment at 1.4px columns: an overview, no letters
react-msaview-cli export-svg --msa kinases.aln --tree kinases.nwk \
  --col-width 1.4 --row-height 16 --tree-area-width 280 -o overview.svg
```

![The same kinase family drawn as a colored overview beside its tree](../../docs/media/cli-quickstart.png)

Residue letters draw only in columns at least 5px wide and wider than half the
row height, and in rows at least 8px tall. The app applies the same rule as you
zoom out. Below that size the figure is the colored overview above, which
usually suits a whole-alignment figure: at that scale the conserved blocks and
gaps are visible, and letters would be too small to read.

### Color schemes

```bash
react-msaview-cli export-svg --msa gpcrs.fa \
  --color-scheme clustalx_protein_dynamic -o gpcrs.svg
```

![The same GPCR rows under the ClustalX scheme](../../docs/media/cli-clustalx.png)

`maeditor` (the default), `clustal`, `clustalx_protein`, `lesk`, `flower`,
`cinema`, and the `jalview_*` family (`jalview_zappo`, `jalview_taylor`,
`jalview_hydrophobicity`, `jalview_buried`, `jalview_prophelix`,
`jalview_propstrand`, `jalview_propturn`) color each residue by identity. The
three `_dynamic` schemes, `clustalx_protein_dynamic`, `percent_identity_dynamic`
and `blosum62_dynamic`, color each residue by the composition of its column, so
conserved columns stand out by color. `blosum62_dynamic` shades each residue by
its mean BLOSUM62 similarity to the rest of its column, so a conservative
substitution reads darker than a radical one. `nucleotide`, `clustalx_dna`,
`jbrowse_dna` and `rainbow_dna` are for DNA; `none` turns background color off.

### Output

The SVG grows with the alignment: a 10-row by 856-column figure is about 700KB.
The background is one embedded image where @napi-rs/canvas is installed, and a
rectangle per cell where it is not. The letters, the tree and the annotations
are vector either way.

An `-o` ending in `.png` or `.pdf` converts the SVG with `rsvg-convert` from
librsvg (`apt install librsvg2-bin`, `brew install librsvg`). A PDF keeps the
letters, the tree and the annotations vector. `--scale` sets the pixels per SVG
unit of a PNG, 2 by default:

```bash
react-msaview-cli export-svg --msa kinases.aln --tree kinases.nwk -o kinases.pdf
react-msaview-cli export-svg --msa kinases.aln --scale 4 -o kinases.png
```

The same input gives the same bytes on one machine, so CI can regenerate a
figure and diff it. With @napi-rs/canvas installed, the export measures labels
with that machine's fonts, so the tree area can come out a few pixels wider or
narrower on another machine.

## Annotating

### interpro

Build a domain GFF from InterPro's **precomputed** matches for UniProtKB
accessions. The EBI InterPro API already serves matches for every UniProtKB
sequence, so the lookup returns in seconds, gives the same result for a given
InterPro release, and needs no email or rate-limited job. Use this instead of
`interproscan` whenever your rows are UniProt accessions.

```bash
react-msaview-cli interpro <accessions.tsv> [options]
```

The input is one accession per line, optionally followed by a tab- or
space-separated row label. The command skips lines starting with `#`. It reads
an isoform (`P04637-2`) or versioned (`P04637.4`) accession as the canonical one
and warns, and stops before any request on an entry name (`P53_HUMAN`), a RefSeq
id or anything else InterPro does not key by; run `interproscan` on those. It
writes through the same GFF writer as `interproscan`, and adds a `#` header line
naming the InterPro release the coordinates came from.

<!-- options:interpro -->

| Option                | Description                                                                         | Default       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `-o, --output <file>` | Output GFF file                                                                     | `domains.gff` |
| `--database <name>`   | InterPro member database to read                                                    | `pfam`        |
| `--msa <file>`        | Alignment the GFF is for; the CLI checks each row's ungapped length against UniProt |               |
| `--format <name>`     | Force the `--msa` format instead of sniffing it                                     |               |
| `--no-cache`          | Re-fetch every accession, ignoring the disk cache                                   |               |

<!-- /options -->

InterPro computes matches on UniProt's canonical sequence. A label ending in
`/start-end`, as Pfam and Stockholm name a fragment row (`P12931/84-145`), moves
each match into the fragment's own positions and clips it to the fragment. On an
isoform row the matches land on the wrong residues. With `--msa`, the CLI
compares each row's ungapped length against the protein's, or against the
range's for a fragment, and warns about any that differ. It also warns about any
accession with no matches.

```bash
react-msaview-cli interpro accessions.tsv -o domains.gff
react-msaview-cli interpro accessions.tsv -o domains.gff --database cdd
```

#### Caching

The InterPro API serves one protein per request and has no batch endpoint, so a
run makes one request per distinct accession. The CLI caches every response on
disk under `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/react-msaview-cli/interpro` (override with
`REACT_MSAVIEW_CACHE`), keyed by InterPro release, so a new release fetches
fresh coordinates. The cache also records proteins with no matches, so a re-run
does not fetch them again.

A re-run of the same dataset makes one request, the release lookup, and reads
the rest from disk. A failed run can therefore resume. The CLI retries with
backoff, and if the API stays unreachable, the accessions it already fetched
stay cached, so the next run fetches only the rest.

When the release lookup fails, the CLI warns and reads the newest release in the
cache, so a fully cached run needs no network.

### interproscan

Run InterProScan on all sequences in an MSA file and output results as GFF3. Use
this when the rows are not UniProt accessions: a de novo assembly, predicted
proteins, or anything else InterPro has not scanned.

```bash
react-msaview-cli interproscan <input-msa> [options]
```

<!-- /options -->

By default (no backend flag) the CLI submits sequences to the EBI InterProScan
REST API one at a time. `--local`, `--docker`, and `--singularity` run
InterProScan on the whole alignment locally, which is much faster for large
datasets.

#### Choosing a backend

```bash
## EBI web API: no install, one sequential submission per sequence
react-msaview-cli interproscan alignment.fasta -o domains.gff --email you@example.com

## Docker: no InterProScan install, whole alignment in one run
react-msaview-cli interproscan alignment.fasta -o domains.gff --docker

## a local install
react-msaview-cli interproscan alignment.fasta -o domains.gff \
  --local --interproscan-path /opt/interproscan/interproscan.sh

## Singularity/Apptainer, for HPC clusters without Docker
react-msaview-cli interproscan alignment.fasta -o domains.gff \
  --singularity --singularity-image /path/to/interproscan.sif
```

Docker mounts a temp directory into the `interpro/interproscan` container, runs
the scan on the whole alignment at once, and reads the JSON back out.

The published image carries InterProScan but **not** its member database data,
which is a separate multi-gigabyte download. Fetch and unpack the matching
release's `data/` directory (see the
[InterProScan docs](https://interproscan-docs.readthedocs.io/)) and point
`--interproscan-data` at it. Both container backends mount it at
`/opt/interproscan/data` and look for it there.

The EBI API has usage limits, so the CLI submits sequences one at a time. Past
about 100 sequences, use a local or container backend.

#### InterProScan programs

`--programs` takes the EBI API's names whichever backend runs: `PfamA` and `CDD`
(the default), `SMART`, `SuperFamily`, `Gene3d`, `PANTHER`, `TIGRFAM`, `HAMAP`,
`PrositeProfiles`, `PrositePatterns`, `PRINTS`, `PIRSF`, `MobiDBLite`, `Coils`,
`SFLD`. InterProScan 5 spells several of them differently (`Pfam`, not `PfamA`;
`NCBIfam`, which absorbed TIGRFAM; `Hamap`; `SUPERFAMILY`; `Gene3D`), and the
CLI passes the translated names to the local, Docker and Singularity backends.

```bash
react-msaview-cli interproscan alignment.fasta -o domains.gff \
  --programs PfamA,SMART,Gene3D --email you@example.com
```

### genestructure

Build a **gene-structure GFF** for a coding-sequence alignment from a RefSeq
transcript, overlaid the same way InterProScan domains are. The command fetches
the exon model from the NCBI Datasets v2 API and names each species' Nth exon
`exon-N`, so a given exon is the same color in every row and the exon
architecture reads straight down the alignment.

```bash
react-msaview-cli genestructure <input-msa> --gene <symbol> --ref <rowname> [options]
```

The command maps the chosen transcript's exon boundaries onto the reference
row's columns, then projects them into every other row's ungapped coordinates.
An exon that picks up a frameshifting indel in one lineage therefore gets
shorter on that row and stays in the same columns as the rest. The reference row
must be the transcript's coding sequence; the CLI warns if its length doesn't
match.

### residue-mappings

Build the
[`residueMappings` layer](https://github.com/GMOD/JBrowseMSA/blob/main/docs/layers.md#residuemappings),
which tells the viewer which residue of a PDB chain or an AlphaFold model each
residue of a row is. The output is `{"residueMappings": [...]}`, ready for the
`residueMappings` prop, a `#data=` link, or the R and Python widgets.

```bash
react-msaview-cli residue-mappings --msa <file> --row <name> --accession <acc> \
  (--pdb <id> --chain <id> | --alphafold) [-o mappings.json]
react-msaview-cli residue-mappings --msa <file> --rows <tsv> [-o mappings.json]

<!-- /options -->

In `--rows`, the structure column is `6VXX:A` or `alphafold`, and a
`row accession structure` header line is optional. A row may appear on several
lines to map it onto several structures.

For each row, the CLI first fetches the accession's sequence from UniProt and
checks the row's ungapped residues against it. A row named `/start-end` has to
match that slice of the protein, and every position in its mapping is a residue
of the row. A mismatch stops the run with the row, the accession and the first
residue where they differ.

For a PDB chain, the segments come from the PDBe SIFTS mapping of the entry, and
`unobserved` lists every position of the chain's entity outside PDBe's observed
ranges. `asymId` is the `struct_asym_id` SIFTS gives for the author chain. For
an AlphaFold model, the model numbers the protein from 1, so the mapping is one
segment and has no `unobserved`.

```console
$ react-msaview-cli residue-mappings --msa spike.afa --row SARS-CoV-2 \
    --accession P0DTC2 --pdb 6VXX --chain A -o mappings.json
  SARS-CoV-2: P0DTC2 onto 6VXX chain A, row 14-1211 at 33-1230
wrote mappings.json
```

## Input formats

The CLI sniffs the format from the file's content, not from its name. `--format`
(`fasta`, `a3m`, `stockholm`, `clustal`, `emf`) overrides a wrong guess. FASTA
and A3M share a leading `>`, so the CLI tells them apart heuristically.

- **FASTA** (`.fasta`, `.fa`, `.faa`)
- **Clustal** (`.clustal`, `.aln`)
- **Stockholm** (`.sto`, `.stockholm`)
- **A3M** (`.a3m`), from AlphaFold/ColabFold
- **EMF** (`.emf`), Ensembl Multi Format

## Annotation output format

The annotation commands write standard GFF3, one line per feature:
`protein_match` for a domain from `interpro`/`interproscan`, `exon` for a
segment from `genestructure`. `start`/`end` are 1-based positions in the
**ungapped** sequence, and the attributes carry the accession, name, and
description:

```gff
##gff-version 3
seq1	InterProScan	protein_match	10	150	.	.	.	Name=PF00001;signature_desc=7tm_1;description=7 transmembrane receptor (rhodopsin family)
seq1	InterProScan	protein_match	200	350	.	.	.	Name=PF00002;signature_desc=7tm_2;description=7 transmembrane receptor (Secretin family)
seq2	InterProScan	protein_match	5	120	.	.	.	Name=PF00001;signature_desc=7tm_1;description=7 transmembrane receptor (rhodopsin family)
```

A worked run:

```console
$ react-msaview-cli interproscan gpcrs.fasta -o domains.gff --docker
Reading MSA from gpcrs.fasta...
Found 4 sequences
Processing 4 non-empty sequences...
  Running InterProScan via Docker on 4 sequences...

Converting results to GFF...
Writing output to domains.gff...
Done!
```

## Using the GFF elsewhere

The web viewer, the React component and the R package all load the file the CLI
writes.

In the web viewer, select it in the import form's **Annotations** field, or open
it over a loaded alignment with **File > Open annotation file…**, which also
accepts the JSON an InterProScan run returns.

In the React component, pass it inline as the `gff` prop:

```jsx
<MSAViewer msa={msaText} gff={domainsGff} />
```

From R:

```r
msaview(msa = "alignment.fasta", gff = "domains.gff")
```

## Troubleshooting

**EBI API timeout.** We measured one sequence waiting fifteen minutes in the
queue. The CLI waits an hour per job and keeps the results of the sequences that
finished. Use `--local`, `--docker`, or `--singularity` to run InterProScan
yourself; on large datasets they are much faster than the API.

**Local InterProScan not found.**

```
Error: Failed to run Local: spawn interproscan.sh ENOENT. Is interproscan.sh installed and on PATH?
```

Give the full path:
`--interproscan-path /full/path/to/interproscan-5.xx/interproscan.sh`

**No results in the output.** Check that the sequences are protein, not
nucleotide; try other `--programs`; verify the input parses as one of the
formats above.

**The exported figure is enormous.** `export-svg` draws the whole alignment at
`--col-width` per column. Lower `--col-width` until it fits. Below 5px, or below
half the row height, the residue letters stop drawing, and they account for most
of the file size.

**The export refuses to draw the entire alignment.** Each residue letter is an
SVG element, and an alignment of 500 rows by 1000 columns takes 3.4GB to export.
Past 500,000 letters the CLI stops with an error unless `--force` is given. A
`--col-width` below 5 or a `--row-height` below 8 draws the same alignment with
no letters, and `--viewport` draws one window of it.
