// PUBLIC API — consumed by external JBrowse 2 plugins. Changing or removing any
// export here is a breaking change for downstream repos:
//   - jbrowse-plugin-msaview (wraps MSAModelF + MSAView into a JBrowse view)
//   - jbrowse-plugin-tview   (the same, for a tree-first view)
// Those plugins also reach into the MsaViewModel instance at runtime; the model
// members they rely on (e.g. mouseCol/setMousePos, setHighlightedColumns,
// seqPosToVisibleCol/visibleColToSeqPos) are flagged inline in model.ts.
// jbrowse-plugin-protein3d no longer depends on this package at all: it reads
// the msaview plugin's model through a structural type of its own.
