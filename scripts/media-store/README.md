# The docs/media blob store

Figure bytes live in `s3://jbrowse.org/msaview-figures/`, and git tracks
`media.lock`: one line per file, `<path> <WxH> <bytes> <sha256>`, sorted by
path.

```sh
pnpm media:status              what docs/media and media.lock disagree about
pnpm media:pull [--force]      install every figure the manifest names
pnpm media:push [--dry-run]    upload new bytes, then rewrite media.lock
pnpm media:check               CI gate: manifest and worktree agree
pnpm media:forget <file>...    retire a figure no page shows; the blob stays
pnpm media:report --base <ref> what moved since <ref>, with before/after images
pnpm media:stale               renderer commits since the last full regen
```

`pnpm check:media` is a different question, and both names are the natural one.
That command asks whether every file in `docs/media` is shown by some rendered
page. `pnpm media:check` asks whether `media.lock` matches the worktree.

## Why the bytes moved

A figure regenerated on a render change is an undeltifiable blob git keeps
forever. Measured 2026-09-16: `docs/media` holds 14 MB across 150 files, and its
history already carries 506 blobs weighing 38.3 MiB of a 241 MB pack. The stock
is small. The rate is the argument: 388 figure revisions landed in September
against 95 in June, 5 in July and 50 in August, because the tutorials and their
figures are now written in bulk. At ~100 KB a revision that is tens of MB a
month that every clone carries and nobody reads.

jbrowse-components hit the same wall and its `website/scripts/figure-store.ts`
carries the reasoning at length. Four properties come from there:

- **Content-addressed**, so a key is never overwritten. This matters more than
  usual on this bucket, whose versioning is Suspended: a PUT by path clobbers in
  place and the old object is gone. `push` only ever creates a key named after
  its own bytes, so re-pushing identical content is a no-op and different
  content is a different key.
- **Immutable**, so every revision ever pushed stays fetchable at its own URL.
  That is what lets `media:report` render BEFORE and AFTER side by side from two
  store URLs, for a manifest line taken from any commit.
- **Nothing is deleted**, including keys no manifest points at. A store URL is a
  public link that goes into review comments and issues, and it should not rot
  because a figure was regenerated. Orphans cost a fraction of a cent a month.
- **Public reads**, so `pull` is a plain HTTPS GET and needs no credentials. A
  contributor, a fork's CI and a cold site build all fetch the same way a reader
  loads the page. Only `push` needs AWS.

`push` uploads bytes before it rewrites the manifest. A `media.lock` line naming
a blob nobody uploaded breaks `pull` for everyone who reads that line first.
Failing the other way leaves orphan blobs, which nobody sees.

## What a regenerated figure now takes

`docs/media` is gitignored, so a regen produces no git change on its own. The
bytes reach other people only through `pnpm media:push`, which uploads them and
rewrites `media.lock`, and that manifest line is what lands in the pull request.
Reviewing one means `pnpm media:report --base main`.

Four commands read the figures off disk, and each pulls first, so a fresh clone
runs any of them with nothing installed:

- `pnpm build:site`, and `build:pages` through it.
  `website/src/lib/tutorials.ts` imports individual figures
  (`import plddtThumb from '../../../docs/media/...'`), so a missing one fails
  the astro build rather than shipping a broken page.
  `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml` inherits the pull from this script.
- `pnpm check:media`, which reads the directory. `.github/workflows/push.yml`
  inherits it the same way.
- `pnpm screenshots` and `pnpm screenshots:all`. The generator's diff gate
  compares a fresh capture against the figure already on disk, so a run with
  nothing there would rewrite all 150 and report every one as moved.

`pnpm figures` needs no pull. It writes the four export SVGs, and all four are
tracked (see below).

CI needs no AWS credentials and no new workflow step. `media:pull` is also the
gate that a manifest line's blob was really uploaded: it verifies every file
against the sha256 on the line and fails loudly on a mismatch, so a `media.lock`
committed without its `media:push` turns the build red.

## Nine figures stay in git

The root README and the `lib`, `cli` and `python` package READMEs link them by
relative path, which GitHub resolves against the repo and npm rewrites to a raw
URL. Gitignoring them breaks those images on both, with no build to catch it,
and pointing the READMEs at store URLs does not help because a store URL carries
the content hash and would go stale on the next regen:

```
cli-clustalx.png  cli-domains.png  cli-letters.png  cli-quickstart.png
example-domains.svg  example-protein.svg  r-quickstart.svg
python-quickstart.png  python-entropy-and-clicks.png
```

`.gitignore` takes `docs/media/*` plus a `!` line for each. Git is their store,
so `media.lock` leaves them out and `media.mjs` skips every file git tracks. A
pull therefore never overwrites a regenerated one with an older blob, and
refreshing one takes a commit and no `media:push`.

`pnpm figures` writes the three README SVGs with the viewer's SVG export under
jsdom, byte for byte the same on every machine. CI runs `pnpm figures:check`,
which fails when the renderer would draw any of them differently.
